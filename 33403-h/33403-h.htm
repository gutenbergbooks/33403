<h2>THE WORK OF GERTRUDE STEIN</h2></div>

<p class="center" style="margin: -1em auto 2em auto; font-size: large;">By SHERWOOD ANDERSON</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="first-word">One</span> evening in the winter, some years ago, my brother
came to my rooms in the city of Chicago bringing
with him a book by Gertrude Stein. The book was
called <cite>Tender Buttons</cite> and, just at that time, there was
a good deal of fuss and fun being made over it in
American newspapers. I had already read a book of
Miss Stein's called <cite>Three Lives</cite> and had thought it contained
some of the best writing ever done by an American.
I was curious about this new book.</p>

<p>My brother had been at some sort of a gathering of
literary people on the evening before and someone had
read aloud from Miss Stein's new book. The party had
been a success. After a few lines the reader stopped
and was greeted by loud shouts of laughter. It was
generally agreed that the author had done a thing we
Americans call &ldquo;putting something across&rdquo;&mdash;the meaning
being that she had, by a strange freakish performance,
managed to attract attention to herself, get herself discussed
in the newspapers, become for a time a figure in
our hurried, harried lives.</p>

<p>My brother, as it turned out, had not been satisfied
with the explanation of Miss Stein's work then current
in America, and so he bought <cite>Tender Buttons</cite> and brought
it to me, and we sat for a time reading the strange sentences.
&ldquo;It gives words an oddly new intimate flavor and
at the same time makes familiar words seem almost like
strangers, doesn't it,&rdquo; he said. What my brother did,
you see, was to set my mind going on the book, and then,
leaving it on the table, he went away.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_6" title="6"> </a>
And now, after these years, and having sat with
Miss Stein by her own fire in the rue de Fleurus in Paris
I am asked to write something by way of an introduction
to a new book she is about to issue.</p>

<p>As there is in America an impression of Miss Stein's
personality, not at all true and rather foolishly romantic,
I would like first of all to brush that aside. I had myself
heard stories of a long dark room with a languid woman
lying on a couch, smoking cigarettes, sipping absinthes
perhaps and looking out upon the world with tired, disdainful
eyes. Now and then she rolled her head slowly
to one side and uttered a few words, taken down by a
secretary who approached the couch with trembling
eagerness to catch the falling pearls.</p>

<p>You will perhaps understand something of my own
surprise and delight when, after having been fed up on
such tales and rather Tom Sawyerishly hoping they might
be true, I was taken to her to find instead of this languid
impossibility a woman of striking vigor, a subtle and
powerful mind, a discrimination in the arts such as I have
found in no other American born man or woman, and a
charmingly brilliant conversationalist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surprise and delight&rdquo; did I say? Well, you see,
my feeling is something like this. Since Miss Stein's
work was first brought to my attention I have been
thinking of it as the most important pioneer work done
in the field of letters in my time. The loud guffaws of
the general that must inevitably follow the bringing forward
of more of her work do not irritate me but I would
like it if writers, and particularly young writers, would
come to understand a little what she is trying to do and
what she is in my opinion doing.</p>

<p>My thought in the matter is something like this&mdash;that
every artist working with words as his medium,
must at times be profoundly irritated by what seems the
limitations of his medium. What things does he not wish
to create with words! There is the mind of the reader
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_7" title="7"> </a>before him and he would like to create in that reader's
mind a whole new world of sensations, or rather one
might better say he would like to call back into life all
of the dead and sleeping senses.</p>

<p>There is a thing one might call &ldquo;the extension of
the province of his art&rdquo; one wants to achieve. One works
with words and one would like words that have a taste
on the lips, that have a perfume to the nostrils, rattling
words one can throw into a box and shake, making a
sharp, jingling sound, words that, when seen on the
printed page, have a distinct arresting effect upon the eye,
words that when they jump out from under the pen one
may feel with the fingers as one might caress the cheeks
of his beloved.</p>

<p>And what I think is that these books of Gertrude
Stein's do in a very real sense recreate life in words.</p>

<p>We writers are, you see, all in such a hurry. There
are such grand things we must do. For one thing the
Great American Novel must be written and there is the
American or English Stage that must be uplifted by our
very important contributions, to say nothing of the epic
poems, sonnets to my lady's eyes, and what not. We
are all busy getting these grand and important thoughts
and emotions into the pages of printed books.</p>

<p>And in the meantime the little words, that are the
soldiers with which we great generals must make our
conquests, are neglected.</p>

<p>There is a city of English and American words and
it has been a neglected city. Strong broad shouldered
words, that should be marching across open fields under
the blue sky, are clerking in little dusty dry goods stores,
young virgin words are being allowed to consort with
whores, learned words have been put to the ditch digger's
trade. Only yesterday I saw a word that once called a
whole nation to arms serving in the mean capacity of
advertising laundry soap.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_8" title="8"> </a>
For me the work of Gertrude Stein consists in a
rebuilding, an entire new recasting of life, in the city of
words. Here is one artist who has been able to accept
ridicule, who has even forgone the privilege of writing
the great American novel, uplifting our English speaking
stage, and wearing the bays of the great poets, to go live
among the little housekeeping words, the swaggering
bullying street-corner words, the honest working, money
saving words, and all the other forgotten and neglected
citizens of the sacred and half forgotten city.</p>

<p>Would it not be a lovely and charmingly ironic gesture
of the gods if, in the end, the work of this artist
were to prove the most lasting and important of all the
word slingers of our generation!</p>

<p>Barnes Colhard did not say he would not do it but
he did not do it. He did it and then he did not do it,
he did not ever think about it. He just thought some
time he might do something.</p>

<p>His father Mr. Abram Colhard spoke about it to
every one and very many of them spoke to Barnes
Colhard about it and he always listened to them.</p>

<p>Then Barnes fell in love with a very nice girl and
she would not marry him. He cried then, his father Mr.
Abram Colhard comforted him and they took a trip and
Barnes promised he would do what his father wanted
him to be doing. He did not do the thing, he thought
he would do another thing, he did not do the other thing,
his father Mr. Colhard did not want him to do the other
thing. He really did not do anything then. When he
was a good deal older he married a very rich girl. He
had thought perhaps he would not propose to her but
his sister wrote to him that it would be a good thing.
He married the rich girl and she thought he was the most
wonderful man and one who knew everything. Barnes
never spent more than the income of the fortune he and
his wife had then, that is to say they did not spend more
than the income and this was a surprise to very many
who knew about him and about his marrying the girl who
had such a large fortune. He had a happy life while he
was living and after he was dead his wife and children
remembered him.</p>

<p>He had a sister who also was successful enough in
being one being living. His sister was one who came to
be happier than most people come to be in living. She
came to be a completely happy one. She was twice as
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_15" title="15"> </a>old as her brother. She had been a very good daughter
to her mother. She and her mother had always told very
pretty stories to each other. Many old men loved to hear
her tell these stories to her mother. Every one who ever
knew her mother liked her mother. Many were sorry
later that not every one liked the daughter. Many did
like the daughter but not every one as every one had
liked the mother. The daughter was charming inside in
her, it did not show outside in her to every one, it certainly
did to some. She did sometimes think her mother
would be pleased with a story that did not please her
mother, when her mother later was sicker the daughter
knew that there were some stories she could tell her
that would not please her mother. Her mother died
and really mostly altogether the mother and the daughter
had told each other stories very happily together.</p>

<p>The daughter then kept house for her father and
took care of her brother. There were many relations who
lived with them. The daughter did not like them to live
with them and she did not like them to die with them.
The daughter, Ada they had called her after her grandmother
who had delightful ways of smelling flowers and
eating dates and sugar, did not like it at all then as she
did not like so much dying and she did not like any of
the living she was doing then. Every now and then some
old gentlemen told delightful stories to her. Mostly then
there were not nice stories told by any one then in her
living. She told her father Mr. Abram Colhard that she
did not like it at all being one being living then. He
never said anything. She was afraid then, she was one
needing charming stories and happy telling of them and
not having that thing she was always trembling. Then
every one who could live with them were dead and there
were then the father and the son a young man then and
the daughter coming to be that one then. Her grandfather
had left some money to them each one of them.
Ada said she was going to use it to go away from them.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_16" title="16"> </a>The father said nothing then, then he said something and
she said nothing then, then they both said nothing and
then it was that she went away from them. The father
was quite tender then, she was his daughter then. He
wrote her tender letters then, she wrote him tender letters
then, she never went back to live with him. He wanted
her to come and she wrote him tender letters then. He
liked the tender letters she wrote to him. He wanted her
to live with him. She answered him by writing tender
letters to him and telling very nice stories indeed in them.
He wrote nothing and then he wrote again and there was
some waiting and then he wrote tender letters again and
again.</p>

<p>She came to be happier than anybody else who was
living then. It is easy to believe this thing. She was
telling some one, who was loving every story that was
charming. Some one who was living was almost always
listening. Some one who was loving was almost always
listening. That one who was loving was almost always
listening. That one who was loving was telling about
being one then listening. That one being loving was
then telling stories having a beginning and a middle and
an ending. That one was then one always completely
listening. Ada was then one and all her living then one
completely telling stories that were charming, completely
listening to stories having a beginning and a middle and
an ending. Trembling was all living, living was all loving,
some one was then the other one. Certainly this one
was loving this Ada then. And certainly Ada all her
living then was happier in living than any one else who
ever could, who was, who is, who ever will be living.</p>

<p>Helen Furr had quite a pleasant home. Mrs. Furr
was quite a pleasant woman. Mr. Furr was quite a
pleasant man. Helen Furr had quite a pleasant voice a
voice quite worth cultivating. She did not mind working.
She worked to cultivate her voice. She did not find it
gay living in the same place where she had always been
living. She went to a place where some were cultivating
something, voices and other things needing cultivating.
She met Georgine Skeene there who was cultivating her
voice which some thought was quite a pleasant one.
Helen Furr and Georgine Skeene lived together then.
Georgine Skeene liked travelling. Helen Furr did not
care about travelling, she liked to stay in one place and
be gay there. They were together then and travelled to
another place and stayed there and were gay there.</p>

<p>They stayed there and were gay there, not very gay
there, just gay there. They were both gay there, they
were regularly working there both of them cultivating
their voices there, they were both gay there. Georgine
Skeene was gay there and she was regular, regular in
being gay, regular in not being gay, regular in being a
gay one who was one not being gay longer than was
needed to be one being quite a gay one. They were both
gay then there and both working there then.</p>

<p>They were in a way both gay there where there were
many cultivating something. They were both regular in
being gay there. Helen Furr was gay there, she was
gayer and gayer there and really she was just gay there,
she was gayer and gayer there, that is to say she found
ways of being gay there that she was using in being gay
there. She was gay there, not gayer and gayer, just gay
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_18" title="18"> </a>there, that is to say she was not gayer by using the things
she found there that were gay things, she was gay there,
always she was gay there.</p>

<p>They were quite regularly gay there, Helen Furr and
Georgine Skeene, they were regularly gay there where
they were gay. They were very regularly gay.</p>

<p>To be regularly gay was to do every day the gay
thing that they did every day. To be regularly gay was
to end every day at the same time after they had been
regularly gay. They were regularly gay. They were gay
every day. They ended every day in the same way, at
the same time, and they had been every day regularly gay.</p>

<p>The voice Helen Furr was cultivating was quite a
pleasant one. The voice Georgine Skeene was cultivating
was, some said, a better one. The voice Helen Furr was
cultivating she cultivated and it was quite completely a
pleasant enough one then, a cultivated enough one then.
The voice Georgine Skeene was cultivating she did not
cultivate too much. She cultivated it quite some. She
cultivated and she would sometime go on cultivating it
and it was not then an unpleasant one, it would not be
then an unpleasant one, it would be a quite richly enough
cultivated one, it would be quite richly enough to be a
pleasant enough one.</p>

<p>They were gay where there were many cultivating
something. The two were gay there, were regularly gay
there. Georgine Skeene would have liked to do more
travelling. They did some travelling, not very much
travelling, Georgine Skeene would have liked to do more
travelling, Helen Furr did not care about doing travelling,
she liked to stay in a place and be gay there.</p>

<p>They stayed in a place and were gay there, both of
them stayed there, they stayed together there, they were
gay there, they were regularly gay there.</p>

<p>They went quite often, not very often, but they did
go back to where Helen Furr had a pleasant enough home
and then Georgine Skeene went to a place where her
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_19" title="19"> </a>brother had quite some distinction. They both went,
every few years, went visiting to where Helen Furr had
quite a pleasant home. Certainly Helen Furr would not
find it gay to stay, she did not find it gay, she said she
would not stay, she said she did not find it gay, she said
she would not stay where she did not find it gay, she said
she found it gay where she did stay and she did stay
there where very many were cultivating something. She
did stay there. She always did find it gay there.</p>

<p>She went to see them where she had always been
living and where she did not find it gay. She had a
pleasant home there, Mrs. Furr was a pleasant enough
woman, Mr. Furr was a pleasant enough man, Helen
told them and they were not worrying, that she did not
find it gay living where she had always been living.</p>

<p>Georgine Skeene and Helen Furr were living where
they were both cultivating their voices and they were
gay there. They visited where Helen Furr had come
from and then they went to where they were living where
they were then regularly living.</p>

<p>There were some dark and heavy men there then.
There were some who were not so heavy and some who
were not so dark. Helen Furr and Georgine Skeene sat
regularly with them. They sat regularly with the ones who
were dark and heavy. They sat regularly with the ones
who were not so dark. They sat regularly with the ones
that were not so heavy. They sat with them regularly,
sat with some of them. They went with them regularly
went with them. They were regular then, they were gay
then, they were where they wanted to be then where it was
gay to be then, they were regularly gay then. There were
men there then who were dark and heavy and they sat
with them with Helen Furr and Georgine Skeene and
they went with them with Miss Furr and Miss Skeene,
and they went with the heavy and dark men Miss Furr
and Miss Skeene went with them, and they sat with them,
Miss Furr and Miss Skeene sat with them, and there were
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_20" title="20"> </a>other men, some were not heavy men and they sat with
Miss Furr and Miss Skeene and Miss Furr and Miss
Skeene sat with them, and there were other men who
were not dark men and they sat with Miss Furr and Miss
Skeene and Miss Furr and Miss Skeene sat with them.
Miss Furr and Miss Skeene went with them and they
went with Miss Furr and Miss Skeene, some who were
not heavy men, some who were not dark men. Miss Furr
and Miss Skeene sat regularly, they sat with some men.
Miss Furr and Miss Skeene went and there were some
men with them. There were men and Miss Furr and
Miss Skeene went with them, went somewhere with them,
went with some of them.</p>

<p>Helen Furr and Georgine Skeene were regularly
living where very many were living and cultivating in
themselves something. Helen Furr and Georgine Skeene
were living very regularly then, being very regular then
in being gay then. They did then learn many ways to be
gay and they were then being gay being quite regular in
being gay, being gay and they were learning little things,
little things in ways of being gay, they were very regular
then, they were learning very many little things in ways
of being gay, they were being gay and using these little
things they were learning to have to be gay with regularly
gay with then and they were gay the same amount they
had been gay. They were quite gay, they were quite
regular, they were learning little things, gay little things,
they were gay inside them the same amount they had
been gay, they were gay the same length of time they
had been gay every day.</p>

<p>They were regular in being gay, they learned little
things that are things in being gay, they learned many
little things that are things in being gay, they were gay
every day, they were regular, they were gay, they were
gay the same length of time every day, they were gay,
they were quite regularly gay.</p>

<p>Georgine Skeene went away to stay two months with
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_21" title="21"> </a>her brother. Helen Furr did not go then to stay with her
father and her mother. Helen Furr stayed there where
they had been regularly living the two of them and she
would then certainly not be lonesome, she would go on
being gay. She did go on being gay. She was not any
more gay but she was gay longer every day than they had
been being gay when they were together being gay. She
was gay then quite exactly the same way. She learned a
few more little ways of being in being gay. She was quite
gay and in the same way, the same way she had been gay
and she was gay a little longer in the day, more of each
day she was gay. She was gay longer every day than
when the two of them had been being gay. She was gay
quite in the way they had been gay, quite in the same way.</p>

<p>She was not lonesome then, she was not at all feeling
any need of having Georgine Skeene. She was not
astonished at this thing. She would have been a little
astonished by this thing but she knew she was not
astonished at anything and so she was not astonished at
this thing not astonished at not feeling any need of having
Georgine Skeene.</p>

<p>Helen Furr had quite a completely pleasant voice and
it was quite well enough cultivated and she could use it
and she did use it but then there was not any way of
working at cultivating a completely pleasant voice when
it has become a quite completely well enough cultivated
one, and there was not much use in using it when one
was not wanting it to be helping to make one a gay one.
Helen Furr was not needing using her voice to be a gay
one. She was gay then and sometimes she used her voice
and she was not using it very often. It was quite completely
enough cultivated and it was quite completely a
pleasant one and she did not use it very often. She was
then, she was quite exactly as gay as she had been, she
was gay a little longer in the day than she had been.</p>

<p>She was gay exactly the same way. She was never
tired of being gay that way. She had learned very many
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_22" title="22"> </a>little ways to use in being gay. Very many were telling
about using other ways in being gay. She was gay
enough, she was always gay exactly the same way, she was
always learning little things to use in being gay, she was
telling about using other ways in being gay, she was
telling about learning other ways in being gay, she was
learning other ways in being gay, she would be using
other ways in being gay, she would always be gay in the
same way, when Georgine Skeene was there not so long
each day as when Georgine Skeene was away.</p>

<p>She came to using many ways in being gay, she came
to use every way in being gay. She went on living where
many were cultivating something and she was gay, she
had used every way to be gay.</p>

<p>They did not live together then Helen Furr and
Georgine Skeene. Helen Furr lived there the longer where
they had been living regularly together. Then neither of
them were living there any longer. Helen Furr was
living somewhere else then and telling some about being
gay and she was gay then and she was living quite
regularly then. She was regularly gay then. She was
quite regular in being gay then. She remembered all the
little ways of being gay. She used all the little ways of
being gay. She was quite regularly gay. She told many
then the way of being gay, she taught very many then
little ways they could use in being gay. She was living
very well, she was gay then, she went on living then,
she was regular in being gay, she always was living very
well and was gay very well and was telling about little
ways one could be learning to use in being gay, and later
was telling them quite often, telling them again and again.</p>

<p class="mixed-small-capped-heading">My Dear Miss Carey: A Story</p>

<p>There were little places to see Fernville, the town,
the hospital, the lying in hospital, the sea-shore and the
city.</p>

<p>Once we met my brother he was ringing a bell. He
needed an umbrella but he would not buy it. I sent him
one not prepaid. Oh yes the people are kind they all
drink together. Even now. No not now. We are late.</p>

<p>Did you see the pear tree. It resembles the figs.
They are often ripe. They grow in great abundance.</p>

<p>We like milk. My father likes milk and coffee.</p>

<p>Whenever there are flowers my mother is angry.
She is even angry with me. That is to say she is generous
enough and wishes everything back. We are all that way.
My brother takes coal away in a little bag for use. All
dark days are necessary. No permission is asked and
it is given. For all day. For all day. Whenever it is
needed. Not whenever it is needed. We do as we say
it is best to do. Even religious people do so.</p>

<p>Come together in Fernville. Not I I thank you.
My brother finds handkerchiefs there. For men. For
men and for women. So does his wife. Many. Not
very many. She brings them with her. Is that so. Many
handkerchiefs are not necessary in Fernville. No indeed.
We dismiss the church. We separate it. We have it
to-day. A great many people call. On one another. Not
altogether that. The post-office. The post-office of my
brother. Now. Not now. Yes he is there now. Since
the war. Yes since the war.</p>

<p>I remember when I was a b of c. I did not speak
to old men then not when I was busy. I waited until
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_24" title="24"> </a>I was tired and then we all sat down and had a cup of
coffee. Coffee is very nourishing. I am very sensitive to
the influence of coffee. So are we all.</p>

<p>Do you think that we are married. That we are all
married. Mr. Weeks is married. He is going to be able
to follow my advice. I advise him to go to my country.
There he will do very well. The only advice I have to
give him is never to live in the city. His wife does not
like the city nor does she like a sunny climate. She is
not able to go about with him. We are all of us leaving
the end of the month.</p>

<p>Do not be angry.</p>

<p>I was very much surprised that water was the same
color.</p>

<p>As what.</p>

<p>As the sun.</p>

<p>I feel that I must go at once.</p>

<p>Did you entirely forget about the other.</p>

<p>Drowning in water.</p>

<p>This is a question that I have never asked about
because in the summer one does not think about it. Now
it is winter but it is as warm as in summer.</p>

<p>Dear friends have a way of relating themselves to
a town. We find in some districts that there are better
ways of investing money. Some find that at the end of
the war they are not able to continue paying on their
houses.</p>

<p>Does this affect you.</p>

<p>Oh no because even if the father of my child is
killed his sister will continue to give the money. She is
obliged to by law.</p>

<p>This makes the whole matter very simple.</p>

<p>Not to me I have always been accustomed to it and
have had some difficulty.</p>

<p>Yes we know we know that it is suddenly cold.</p>

<p>You are not pleased to see the sun setting. Indeed I
cannot blame you.</p>

Polybe in Port: A Curtain Raiser</p>

<p>Polybe in Port.</p>

<p>A hunter. He was not a hunter. He had a gun.
I do not know whether they have permission to shoot.</p>

<p>Of course he must have if he has a gun. In this
country they have a great many dogs who hunt rabbits.
They run quicker.</p>

<p>We are surprised to see him.</p>

<p>Polybe is an ornament.</p>

<p>He is not thinner.</p>

<p>He likes the water now.</p>

<p>This I do not believe.</p>

<p>Neither do I believe there was any intention to go
that way. Which way do you mean. Polybe does not
remember. Me. Yes. The house. Yes. The servant.
Yes. You are not mistaken.</p>

<p>We are not mistaken.</p>

<p>A great many shrubs every one of which are labelled.</p>


<p class="mixed-small-capped-heading">Scene&nbsp;II.</p>

<p>A credit to me.</p>

<p>The cares and duties of a mother had been denied to
Carrie Russell.</p>

<p>Polybe silent.</p>

<p>He said earnestly that it didn't matter.</p>


<p class="mixed-small-capped-heading">Spanish Chattings</p>

<p>Do you keep books.</p>

<p>All weddings are back.</p>

<p>Pigeons.</p>

<p>Pigeons recognise persons. Do they. We saw them.
They flew around.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_26" title="26"> </a>
Shooting pigeons is necessary. For what. For the
sea.</p>

<p>I see old peppers that are dried. We do not complain.
We say winds are violent and I do not wish them.
Wish for them. I do not wish to see the stars. Call it
out of here. You mean that pole. No indeed I don't
mean Inca.</p>

<p>Oh yes certainly.</p>


<p class="mixed-small-capped-heading">They Came Together</p>

<p>I can tell a little story. I cannot describe the character
nor the color in the street nor the kind of a stone.
A great many people have silver purses.</p>


<p class="mixed-small-capped-heading">Wild Flowers</p>

<p>We collected wild flowers. We enjoyed it very
much. In a window we saw exhibited the things that
can be found in the country.</p>

<p>There was a satisfaction that we had the temporary
installation which made it possible for us to ask another
servant not to visit our servant. We did not do so. We
were not neglectful of our best interests.</p>


<p class="mixed-small-capped-heading">Will They Crush Germany</p>

<p>They will crush Germany. There is no doubt about it.</p>

<h2><a name="FRANCE">FRANCE</a></h2></div>


<p>Likely and more than evenly, unevenly and not unlikely,
very much that and anyway more, this is the left
over method. There is nothing left because if it were left
it would be left over. This does not make music. The
time to state that is in reading. There is a beginning in
a lesson in smiling.</p>

<p>What is up is not down and what is down is not reversing
and what is refused is not a section and what is
silenced is not speaking. This does not make the rude
ones murmur, this does not make a penny smaller, this
does not make religion.</p>

<p>All the time there is a melodrama there is monopoly
and all the time there is more there is no excuse.</p>

<p>A luck in breaths is more to be denied than music,
much more. The only long string is that which is not
twisted. All the same there is no excuse.</p>

<p>A sight is not a shadow and a whole rise in a cry
is not more piercing than danger of being mixed into an
affair where there are witnesses. If writing is in little
pieces and little places and a little door is open, many
little doors are not open and writing is not surreptitious,
it is not even obliging.</p>

<p>To show the difference between an occasion and
merit and a button it is necessary to recognise that an
honor is not forced so that there is no question of taste.
To exchange a single statue for a coat of silk and a coat
of wool is not necessary as there are appliances. A
somber day is one when there is no pleading.</p>

<p>Made in haste, not made in haste, made in darkness,
not made in darkness, made in a place, made in a place.
The whole stretched out is not part of the whole block,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_28" title="28"> </a>the whole stretched out is so arranged that there is not
stumbling but what is just as remarkable, pushing. An
easy expression of being willing, of being hunting, of
being so stupid that there is no question of not selling, all
these things cause more discussion than a resolution and
this is so astonishing when there is nothing to do and an
excellent reason for an exchange, and yet the practice
of it makes such an example that any day is a season.</p>

<p>To be sure that the trees have winter and the plants
have summer and the houses painting, to be sure of this
engages some attention. The time to place this in the
way is not what is expected from a diner. The whole
thing that shows the result is the little way that the balls
and the pieces that are with them which are not birds
as they are older do not measure the distance between
a cover and a calendar. This which is not a question is
not reverse and the question which is a question is at
noon.</p>

<p>To question a special date is not mercenary. To
answer a single servant is not obligatory. To be afraid
is not nearsighted. An exclamation does not connect
more grass than there is with any more trees than have
branches. The special scenery which makes the blameless
see and the solitary resemble a conversation is not that
which resembles that memory. There is no necessity
for furthering the regulation of the understanding. One
special absence does not make any place empty. The
dampness which is not covered by a cloth is not mingled
with color. And it comes. There is no astonishment
nor width.</p>

<p>Education, education, apprenticeship, and all the
meeting of nephews and trains and changing papers and
remaining when there is no chance to go there, all this
occupied a whole sentence. It is a shame that there is
not such an only use for that, it is a shame and there is
no indignation more indignant. Everything is an indication
of the simple remedy that is applied when there is no
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_29" title="29"> </a>refusal and no application. Every thing which shows
that is not tied with a string or any little string. All the
same there is not much of a remedy.</p>

<p>Alarm over the action of the one who when he sees
the light rise and the sun set and the stars shine and the
water flow alarm is the same alarm as any alarm.</p>

<p>In all the same ways that pieces are separated in all
these ways there are those placed things which are not
pieces. They are not pieces and there is reason, there is
reason in it because the whole thing shows such dissociation
that all doing it for that purpose and together there
can be no question but that they succeed.</p>

<p>A tobacco habit is one that a leaf does not enlighten
and yet carelessness is so extraordinary. Supposing that
the arrangement had been made and that it was agreed
that no separation between any one being one and being
another one could be established, supposing this were
agreed and there was no conversation, would this enlighten
any one, if it would why is the result so ambiguous.
It is not ambiguous because the authority which
does not authorise washing does supply soap. This does
not make any change.</p>

<p>It is sensible to be around it is very sensible, it is
so sensible that there is every way of stopping a selection,
and then there is selection, there is a respect for resignation,
there is no disturbance in a disappointment. The
question is is there more urging than satisfaction, is there
more distribution than renewal. This is not a question, it
is a relaxing. And then the time comes for more noise.
Is there then more noise. There is then reestablishment.
Does that mean return of a price which is plentiful.
Nobody knows. All this shows something it shows that
there can be suspicion.</p>

<p>There is no separation in majesty. Terms, lines,
sections, extra packing, nothing shows that confidence.
All the same there is news. The time to stay away is in
vacation. Why is there no place chosen. The answer
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_30" title="30"> </a>is simple it consists in explaining that there has been given
the use of all that will be used. This does not show
feeling.</p>

<p>A curtain is not crazy, it has no way of being crazy,
it has hardly a way of enraging a resemblance, it has no
resurrection. Indeed the chances are that when there is
seen more astonishment than anything that is placed it
is very likely that the whole system will be not so much
estranged as devastated and yet supposing they do not
mean that, supposing they do say that it will be a success,
supposing they do say does that mean that oration is
contradiction, it does not.</p>

<p>Just a word to show a kite that clouds are higher
than a thing that is smaller, just that word and no single
silence is closer.</p>

<p>Suggest that the passage is filled with feathers,
suggest that there are all together, suggest that using
boxes is heavy, suggest that there is no feather, suggest
all these things and what is result the result is that everything
gets put away.</p>

<p>All the silence is adequate to a rumble and all the
silliness is adequate to a procession and all the recitation
is equal to the hammer and all the paving is equal to
summer. All the same the detaining most is the reason
that there is a pillar and mostly what is shocking is a
rooster. This is not so easily said. There is no occasion
for a red result.</p>

<p>Laugh, to laugh, all the same the tittle is inclinable.
What a change from any yesterday.</p>

<p>A period of singular results and no gloom such a
period shows such a rapid approach that there is no
search in silence and yet not a sound, not any sound is
searching, no sound is an occasion.</p>

<p>A fine fan and a fine closet and a very fine handkerchief
and quite a fine article all these together shows
where there has been plenty of rebuke and plenty of expectation
and plenty, plentifully reduction of suspension,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_31" title="31"> </a>and so the season is the same and there is every corner.</p>

<p>No chance shows the rapidity of exchange, no chance
and this which means one is the same as any two halves
and this is not outrageous, not a bit outrageous it is
simply the sign of splendor.</p>

<p>All the tempting and the chewing and the cloth all
of it shows no sign and no symbol it does not and that
is no disgrace.</p>

<p>If standing is an illusion is it necessary to be pressed
to bend in that direction is it necessary and if it is
necessary is it polite and if it is polite is it urgent and
if it is not urgent is it an impulse.</p>

<p>No question has so much disturbance as the principal
reunion. This is not so distinguished when there are no
ties in the window. This is completely changed, once
there were none and now there are none. There are no
rebukes. A privilege is not painful. A recurrence is not
artificial.</p>

<p>It is not separating that which satisfies no finger, it
is not fading. What was it that was not wished. The
reason is that the section is there and no reflection makes
abundance. The only tangle is when there is abundance
and there is abundance when there is pulling and piling.
Does this seem to scream, it does not there is not even
clustering and yet not hampering not singling everything
does not make sorrow, it makes no plant grander, it does
make a plant slender, it does not make it so slender that
there is every size. All privilege and all practice, all
suspicion and grandeur, all the timber and a little wood
all this makes silver, paper is chosen and gold is cheap,
does this make a little salt, it does not, it makes copper.</p>

<p>Little frame if it is cheaper than a big one is a
different size. There is no use disputing as memory is a
reminder.</p>

<p>Not to pay for a conversation, not to pay anything
for any conversation, not to throw away paying, not to
pass paying, not to pay anything this is not being a victim.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_32" title="32"> </a>What is victory, victory is that which eschewing liberation
and a girdle and gratitude and resignation and a
choice display and more flavor shows a strange reluctance
to have a maritime connection. This is victory.</p>

<p>A license, what is a license, what is a license.</p>

<p>An angry coat, a very angry coat shines.</p>

<p>Butter is not frozen, this does not mean that there is
no bravery and no mistake. This does show a conclusion.</p>

<p>Difference is no excuse, grain is no excuse, even the
remains of a pear is an excuse and yet is there graciousness,
there is if there is generosity. There is so much
fruit. This is kindly a mistake. No misunderstanding
is insurmountable.</p>

<p>Cage no lion, not to cage a lion is not dirty, it is not
even merciless, it is not malodorous, it is not virtue.</p>

<p>To surround a giraffe, what does that mean. To
surround a mixture, that means something.</p>

<p>Solid, what is solid, is more solid than everything,
it is not doubtful because there is no necessity.</p>

<p>Haughtiness, there is haughtiness when there is no
tape and no billiard rooms and no need to be secured
from wet. There is certainly some selected obstacles.</p>

<p>The certainty of a change in the parts that speak,
this uncertainty does not show as it does not fashion
speech. All union is in the widow and all menace is in
the band.</p>

<p>Any way to bend the hat is the way to encourage vice.
Virtue all virtue is resolved and some and any hat, every
hat is identical. A shadow a white shadow is a mountain.</p>

<p>Kindness what is kindness, kindness is the necessity
of preserving of really preserving all the parts of speech
and teaching, not music so much as trimming and a costume,
and sincerely most sincerely shoving regions
together.</p>

<p>Notice a room, in noticing a room what is there to
notice, the first thing to notice is the room and the windows
and the door and the table and the place where there
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_33" title="33"> </a>are divisions and the center of the room and the rest of
the people. All this is necessary and then there is finance.</p>

<p>Heavy where heaviness is and no mistake plentifully,
heavy where the breeze is and no darkness plentifully,
heavy where there is a voice and a noise and singling out
a company, heavy where there is a sale of accents and
raisins and possibly more ways of not being heavy.
Certainly there is no peril and yet think, think often, is
daintiness and a collar heavy is it and what is the disturbance,
is there not more registration.</p>

<p>So there is not coming anything. There certainly is
no single space useful and betrothed and vulgar and not
pretty. There is a sign in placing nothing. This changes
from day to day any day. Surely no change is a blessing.
All the search is in violation and yet a single search is a
single search willing. It is cautious. There is riot.</p>

<p>The likelihood of dipping and drawing and digesting
and drinking and dirtying not dirtying smoking, the likelihood
of all this makes such an order that every discussion
is simultaneous. A large increase in beer, any large increase
is here, some large increase is clear, no large increase
is dear. A lily a very lily lily is accurate and
described and surrounded and so venturesome that there
is risk and writing, there is even inlaying.</p>

<p>Darkness, there is no darkness in extremity and in
mixing and in originating scattering religion. There is
no darkness in designing.</p>

<p>A group a single group proceeding show the necessity
of the distribution of the same organization as there is if
there is, assuming that there is, if there is reorganization.</p>

<p>Flower, flower and water and even more even a gram
of grain and a single little blister, very likely the chance
is not perfect and the exquisite arrangement has lace,
very likely there are no stains and more likely there are
ruffles. In all of this there is no use in practicing medicine.
Quinine any quinine is useful and more there is
more, there can be more, there is an apartment.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_34" title="34"> </a>
A sign of saving consists in spending the late morning
in the morning and in urging in certainly not urging
a calculation. A sign of saving is so simple if there is
enough handed about, and surely no pains in piling are
more shown than when everything is in dishes. This does
not happen in an asylum, it does not even happen in the
hay and in the double shapes that shelter cooking.</p>

<p>A top a tiny little top that sits and spits and shows
the courage calmly, this this is so soon an exasperation
and a piece of lightning, it is so ordinarily just that
occasion, it is so kindly dispiriting, it is so haughty if
there is pushing. There is pushing, this is what makes
it repetition.</p>

<p>A <ins title="log">long</ins>, what is a log to do when it floats, it is to do
nothing as it floats but certainly it would be best that it
should adjust that to itself certainly. This alone does not
make an explanation.</p>

<p>A degree of resorts and a shining wave all this together
does not make a regulation and it does not make
that irregular, it sustains mischief and an order and it
even enforces the likelihood of the season and some color.
So sustained is a paragraph that a sentence shows no
staring and some noise. This is so simple in the size that
is medium and is medium sized sentinel. There is no
kilometer. That does not make a sample.</p>

<p>Keep the place that is not open, close the place that
has one door, shut the place that has a cellar, suffer where
all suffer more, argue, and shelter the understanding
orphan, and silence that is silence is not sufficient there
must even be sleep.</p>

<p>Puzzle is more than a speck and a soiled collar.
A pound is more than oat meal and a new institution.
A silence is no more than occasional. It respects understanding
and salt and even a rope. It respects a news-stand
and it also it very also respects desert. All the ice
can descend together.</p>

<p>Was there freedom, was there enchaining, was there
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_35" title="35"> </a>even a height rising from higher. If there was what is a
coat worth and by whom was it made when.</p>

<p>A lining any lining is a trimming. More trimming
is extra.</p>

<p>A sort of arranging, a kindling of paying a shilling,
does that mean another extravagance and more candles,
no more candles. It does not show.</p>

<p>A famous single candle has a chance to shine so
that glaring meant that no more would be reversed by
lightning. The safe lamp and the bright lamp and the
dirty lamp and the long lamp were all not the lamps that
were attending baptism. Why is the baptism patient,
baptism is patient in the first place because there is no
coarse cloth, in the second place because when there is
nothing taken enough is left to give every reason. A
practice which engaged more attention than the rest was
that which shaved a tame stopper and did not even end
that. Supposing crossing a street is necessary, supposing
it is, does that show more of such occasion. It does and
it does.</p>

<p>A lime is in labor, a lemon is cooler, a citron is larger,
a currant is redder, a strawberry is more vexed, a banana
is straighter.</p>

<p>A little thing is a little thing, a single point is bigger,
a bigger thing is a bigger thing, an older thing is older,
an older thing is an older thing, a station is a station, a
station is a station and a station is a thing and stationary
only that is a stationary thing.</p>

<p>A blind being blind and deaf and deaf being deaf
and blind and blind and deaf and a coat with a cape and
more use in all than in any shape all this makes a reason
for criticising the use of machinery and paper and even
a pen and even a stamp and even more flags than ever.</p>

<p>In the pin in the picking of a pin, in sewing a little
feather and avoiding deserting a pin, in retaining the
feather and arranging to rank the pin as a pin and to hold
it there where if it is seen it is found and if it is found
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_36" title="36"> </a>it is seen, to not mark a pin and select a pin all this is
a reason for using that way of waiting.</p>

<p>A standard blessed is a standard that is blue if it is
blue and blue and white when it is blue and white.
Supposing there is no money, supposing there is no dress
and no skirt, supposing there is no window and no bed,
supposing there is no more distribution and not any more
violence, supposing there is not even arithmetic and intelligence,
supposing there is a light and a round hole,
does that mean that there is no success suggested. It
does not. A little bit of choice makes a color regular.
A little bit of black makes dinner necessary.</p>

<p>If there is a shape a real shape prettily, if there is
and there is no wonder does it happen all the time, if it
does not is there a certainty that there is collusion. These
interesting questions crowd the house, they crowd, they
do not crowd everywhere. They crowd separately.</p>

<p>All there is of more chances is in a book, all there is
of any more chances is in a list, all there is of chances is
in an address, all there is is what is the best place not to
remain sitting and suggesting that there is no title for
relieving rising.</p>

<p>An excursion, what is an excursion, an excursion is
a picnic if it is recurrent, it is a picnic if there is no

large horses are not peculiar, very splendid horses are
not peculiar, horses are peculiar regularly and with an
awake resemblance to the best the very best description
and regret. The kindness of this is mentioned and very
often quite often the same rebuke is outrageous.</p>

<p>Not allowed, not only allowed to eat, to ache, to resemble,
to project, to make a motion, to study preaching,
to stumble on anything, to stretch audibly.</p>

<p>Not allowed a prize or a couch or even what is not

allowed more entirely, not allowed a dispensary.</p>

Surprise an engagement, surprise it so that an agreement

<p>To linger in the pale way and not to show spots to

<p>Eating and paper.</p>

<p>A laugh in a loop is not dinner. There is so much to
pray.</p>

<p>A slight price is a potatoe. A slimness is in length
and even in strength.</p>

<p>A capable extravagance that is that which shows no
provision is that which when necessity is mild shows a
certain distribution of anger. This is no sign of sin.</p>

<p>Five, five are more wonderful than a million. Five
million, five million, five million, five are more wonderful
than two together. Two together, two together.</p>

<p>A song, if a sad song is in unison and is sung, a
sad song is singing. A sign of singing.</p>

<p>A gap what is a gap when there is not any meaning
in a slice with a hole in it. What is the exchange between
the whole and no more witnesses.</p>

<p>Press juice from a button, press it carelessly, press
it with care, press it in a storm. A storm is so waiting
and awful and moreover so much the worse for being
where there is a storm that the use the whole use of more
realization comes out of a narrow bridge and water
faucets. This is no plain evidence of disaster. The point
of it is that there is a strange straw being in any strange
ice-cream.</p>

<p>A legal pencil a really legal pencil is incredible, it
fastens the whole strong iron wire calender.</p>

<p>An inherent investigation, does that mean murder or
does it only mean a railroad track with plenty of cinders.</p>

<p>Words that cumber nothing and call exceptionally
tall people from very far away are those that have the
same center as those used by them frequently.</p>

<p>Bale, bale is a thing that surrounding largely means
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_40" title="40"> </a>hay, no hay has any more food than it needs to weigh
that way henceforward and not more that most
likely.</p>

<p>A soap, a whole soap, any piece of a whole soap,
more whole soap and not mistily, all this is no outrage
and no blessing. A precious thing is an oily thing. In
that there is no sugar and silence.</p>

<p>A reason is that a curly house an ordinary curly
house is exactly that, it is exactly more than that, it is
so exactly no more than more than that.</p>

<p>Waiter, when is a waiter passive and expressed, a
waiter is so when there is no more selection and really no
more buckets altogether. This is what remains. It does.
It is kindly exacted, it is pleased, it is anxious, it is even
worthy when a material is like it. It is.</p>

<p>What is a hinge. A hinge is a location. What is
a hinge necessarily.</p>

<p>When the butter cup is limited and there are radishes,
when radishes are clean and a whole school, a real school
is outrageous and more incensed, really more incensed
and inclined, when the single satisfaction is so perfect
and the pearl is so demure when all this is changed then
there is no rattle there is hardly any rattle.</p>

<p>A and B and also nothing of the same direction is
the best personal division there is between any laughing.
The climate, the whole thing is surrounded, it is not
pressed, it is not a vessel, it is not all there is of joining,
it is a real anxious needful and it is so seldom circular,
so more so than any article in the wire. The cluster is
just the same ordinarily.</p>

<p>Supposing a movement is segregated and there is a
piece of staging, suppose there is and the present is melted
does that mean that any salt is bitter, would it change
an investigation suddenly, when it would would it mean
a long wide and not particular eddy. Would it and if
it did would there be a change. A kind of exercise is
hardest and the best excellence is sweet.</p>

a short set color and a collar and a color. A last degree

is not sliding, it is not a measure of the increasing
swindling of elastic and breaking.</p>

yesterday, it is the resolution of today, it is no pain.</p>

<p>What is pain, pain is so changing the climate and the
best ever that it is a time, it is really only a time, it is
so winding. It is even.</p>

<p>A warm banana is warm naturally and this makes
an ingredient in a mixture which has banana in it.</p>

<p>Cooling in the chasing void, cooling more than

<p>Hold that ho, that is hold the hold.</p>

to any one to have seen that one, to have heard that one.
It would have been discouraging to see more of them.
It was disillusioning to go to the place where there were
many of them. If there were many of them then there
were more than one. If there were more than one then
there were many of them and if there were many of them
one could know any one of them and if one knew any

too many of them. There are many of them and most of

of doing what they are doing, they have a way of not
doing what they are not doing. They have a way of
having some feeling about them that they are ones doing
what they are doing in the way that is a thing satisfying
the desire of having anybody do anything. They are
ones that give to some feeling them a feeling of knowing
that they will not do in a way that is satisfying anything
they are doing. They are ones talking, they are ones
doing something, they are ones waiting quickly waiting
very quickly waiting for anything to be happening and
easily going on with waiting, with waiting for anything
to happen, to not happen again. They are ones talking
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_47" title="47"> </a>and talking and they are ones quick in talking and waiting
for something to happen and they are ones who are not
so quick, not quick enough not to be slow ones, quite
slow ones. They are ones very many are seeing. There
are very many of them. There are quite enough of them.
There are not too many of them. Certainly very many
are pleased at their being completely existing, certainly
very many are completely pleased by their being completely
existing.</p>

<p>There are not too many of them. They have something
growing on them, some of them, a good many of
them, and certainly very many others would not be wanting
such things to be growing out of them that is to say
growing on them. It makes them, those having such
things, makes them elegant and charming, makes them
ugly and disgusting, makes them clean looking and sleek
and rich and dark, makes them dirty looking and fierce
and annoying.</p>

<p>They are not peculiar ones these, they are very many
of them, they are a kind of them, they are natural ones
for any one to be knowing, there are many kinds of this
kind of them. They are talking, often talking and they
are doing things with pieces of them while they are
talking and they are then sounding like something, they
are then certainly sounding in a way that is a way that
is a natural way for them to be sounding, they are having
noise come out of them in a natural way for them to
have noise come out of them. There are very many of
them, not at all too many of them. Very many hear
them, quite enough hear them. There are not too many
of them not at all too many of them, they are talking,
they are moving their fingers and their arms and their
hands then and they have noises coming out of them
and some are hearing them, quite a number hear them
and some like them, very many like them, very many tell
about liking them, some do not like them, some tell about
not liking them.</p>

<p>There are very many of one kind of them and they
are not all the same, certainly not all the same. They are
in a way the same and yet not so much so that some of
them are not altogether like some who are not at all of
that kind of them. When there are very many of them
together they are more like each other, they are and they
seem to be and that is natural. They are, that is natural
because they are together. They seem to be, and that is
natural because what is in one is carried over to the other
one by it being in the feeling of the one looking at the
one and then at the other one.</p>

<p>There are a good many of that kind of them and it
is a good thing, certainly it is not a bad thing. Certainly
not any one is really objecting to their being ones being
existing. They are ones who are being living and then
they go on being living and some of them are not then
being living, and they like it being living and they can
bear it to be not being living. It is not a sad thing that
they are not being living those who are not being living.
It is not a sad thing that they are being living those who
are being living. It is a gentle thing. It is a lively
enough thing. It is a pleasant enough thing. It is an
important enough thing. There are very many of them
who are not any longer being living. It is an accepted
thing. It is a quiet thing. It is a pleasant thing. It is
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_49" title="49"> </a>a certain thing. It is a thing not remembered, not forgotten.
It is a thing existing. It is a thing persisting.
It is a thing contenting any one. It is a thing disturbing
some. It is a thing any one can have had happen in
knowing any place where some of this kind of them have
been living.</p>

<p>It is a kind of them who are existing who are ones
very many are visiting. Very many always have been
visiting them. Very many are going on visiting them
and that is a natural thing.</p>

<p>They will do something and they do do things and
they will offer to do something and they will then not be
surprised if they are not succeeding. They will expect
something and they are surprised if they are not succeeding
and some of them are surprised and are quick then
and some of them are surprised and are slow then and
they are surprised and really then being surprised is not
existing in them, really not, they are not surprised that
they have not been succeeding. Certainly some of them
are surprised if they are not succeeding but certainly
being alike all of them is in not being surprised that they
are not succeeding.</p>

<p>There are very many of them. And they are alike,
all of them. Certainly they are not alike all of them.
Certainly not. They are certainly not alike all of them.
They are alike all of them. They are expecting something,

<p>It is not a melancholy thing being one of them. It
is not an interesting thing being one of them. It is not
an exciting thing being one of them, it is not an important

being all of them. It is a pleasant thing being with them.
It is not a pleasant thing expecting anything from them.
It is not a disconcerting thing expecting anything from
them. It is an agreeable thing knowing about them.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_50" title="50"> </a>It is an exciting thing first hearing about them. It is a
delightful thing coming among them although it is a
frightening thing the first seeing of them. It is a very
pleasant thing living where they are living. It is a completely

troublesome thing waiting for any one of them. It is a
troublesome thing waiting for them to go on finishing
anything. It is not an exasperating, not a disconcerting

thing not exciting, not disconcerting, that is a thing that
is a thing that is growing in a certain arrangement that
is a solid, unexciting, definite, beautiful enough thing,
that is a thing that is something that each one being that

are certainly sounding very pleasant when they are not
sounding harsh and terrifying and unpleasant. They are
certainly sounding pleasantly and that is sometimes a
surprising thing and it is sometimes a surprising thing
that they are not always pleasantly sounding. It is quite
a serious thing deciding if they are pleasing to one or not
pleasing to one. It is quite a serious thing coming to a
decision. If they are pleasing to one that is an important
thing. If they are not pleasing to one that is an important
thing.</p>

<p>If some of them were different, not so very different,
they would not be so willing to go on being living. If
some of them were different and not so very different
they would be certain to be expecting something. If some

be winning something. If some of them were different,
not really different, they would be quite certain not to

<p>Some are needing that not any one is one some are
not wondering about and then again and again finding
that they are knowing everything that that one is ever
doing. Very many are needing this thing and these then
are ones being living and these then being ones being
living are ones sometimes singing and sometimes making
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_56" title="56"> </a>noises in being ones just then not wondering and not
knowing anything about any one doing anything. So then
all of them all of each of them that are being existing and
being ones being such ones are being ones who are ones
being ones of this kind of them. This kind then are all
of them for all of them are of this kind of them.</p>

<p>Many of them, any of them are ones that are completely

Any one could know this thing that any kind of them

<h2><a name="THE_HISTORY_OF_BELMONTE">I MUST TRY TO WRITE THE HISTORY
OF BELMONTE</a></h2></div>


<p>If Maddalena comes I am going to be asleep. You
can entertain your enemy much quicker. If a servant
is your friend there is no getting rid of her.</p>

<p>Belmonte is a bull-fighter. I have not seen him.
He is sick. He had bronchitis and now he's wounded.
They put him in a specially prepared place and they say
the wound is serious. He will recover. It is said that
the Queen hit the King. Not here. In Greece. So be it.</p>

<p>This is going to be the story of Cook. Oh yes that
will be alright.</p>

<p>The story of Belmonte is that we know he is hurt in
the leg. A Mexican is to take his place. The man at
the Cafe Artistos after much experience likes him better
and says that though not good looking has better
technique.</p>

<p>The dog. He thought he wanted it at once. The
curtain. They wanted it and liked to look with a telescope.
First he came that way then the same women had
places. They can read.</p>

<p>Cook does and he says and he is kind to all. He has
french as a friend and he speaks Mallorcan. He understands
all. He is so kind.</p>

<p>Continually fatten. They continually fatten. She
is so. She likes it. She says she is dreadfully bitten.</p>

<p>This is the way they met. He was abroad and he
was used to English. Not to speak but to be disappointed.
He was never disappointed. He spoke it. He called it.
He spoke in a low tone. He said I am sorry I have no
faults I am without fear but I have no money, I am not
afraid of that and I am not reckless. I am very careful.
I always pay back.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_71" title="71"> </a>
He does. He never said I said so. I said Mrs.
Hardy was right when she said he had honest eyes. He
is fond of swimming.</p>

<p>We saw it. She could not go because it was hot.
The one who was advertised was a failure. The other
one the one we had seen had learnt how to do somethings
very nearly and he did it using all his old vigor and carrying
it successfully. A man of talent and plenty. He
had blue eyes. He was carried away. By whom. By
many men. They were really there. The other one is
one one is not sorry for. He is too old for yesterday
and we remember him. We remember him at the same
time two years ago and he was not the strongest man or
even the good one. I do not understand why they speak
to him.</p>

<p>Belmonte.</p>

<p>We have not seen him.</p>

<p>After all he doesn't talk french very fluently and so
perhaps it would be better if only you came to dinner.
Of course you know best.</p>

<p>The moon.</p>

<p>The moon rises more to the left every night considerably
more.</p>

<p>I remember how I felt about it, we began on top
and slowly came down and this time we were down but
there was no liveliness in it. Even if there had been
anything delicate it would not have been pleasurable.
That's how I felt about it.</p>

<p>Don't listen to her.</p>

<p>In places they go to see their husbands. They wait
until he is off the boat. Then they rush.</p>

<p>It is a sweet story.</p>

<p>Don't come up after ten. If you want to come come
alone that's alright but don't come with Fanny after ten.</p>

<p>I love you Fanny Fanny is your name isn't it.</p>

<p>This is <ins title="the">they</ins> way they disturb him.</p>

<p>Belmonte Belmonte.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_72" title="72"> </a>
They are going to have an opportunity at night.
Not he. Horses. They are going to do it in the way we
have not seen. It is not right to wear those clothes made
by a dressmaker who eats lunch. No.</p>

<p>All men are dark and women white.</p>

<p>We went out and saw six soldiers and a woman.</p>

<p>A little boy Bartholomew goes to school in the hot
weather August and June. Also July. July and August.
His father is proud. He says he does not eat too much.
He does not eat enough. He learns English french
spanish and Arabic. Arabic is for the Arabs. He learns
it so that he can speak it. He is not a son of a
baker. He is the son of a hotel keeper. A small hotel.
Nobody sleeps there.</p>

<p>Capable of studying. He is capable of studying.
We were not sure that she was french. We thought
she spoke it. How do you know how to say we do not
care about lemonade.</p>

<p>We have not yet mentioned that on the twenty-first
there will be an opportunity to see fighting when it is
lighted by electric light. We will certainly go by this
means. They say that the effect is not interesting.</p>

<p>This is not the history of Belmonte because there
are so many mounted men. We said we did not admire
them here but we have admired them. We said this instructedly.
Today we were pleased to see our servant.
He said that electricity does not work on Sunday.</p>

<p>Cook works.</p>

<p>He said he asked every one about Guano and they
said he worked better than Belmonte. If so they are
both of the school of Gallito, in the manner of Gallito
who does continually what he does a little. He is no
doubt incorrect in what he had heard. He often is.
He does not understand. Nevertheless there are horses
and electric light. We will see.</p>

<p>Today we walked. We walked up and around the
hill. One would speak of this as not having taken a very
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_73" title="73"> </a>long time. We were full of discussion. We were
frightened that evening. No we weren't. Certainly we
said we were plain. Dear things. What is it.</p>

<p>This is not like his painting. Talk about Mathilda.</p>

<p>Grief for Belmonte.</p>

<p>He did not hurt his foot. It was Cocherita of <ins title="Bilbao,">Bilbao.</ins>
who hurt his foot. He hurt it so badly that he cannot
walk.</p>

<p>Tonight it is very different.</p>

<p>Cocherita de Bilbao. He is not an American. Torquito
is. He reminds us of it. He is very successful.
He is intelligent and he is strong and he has blue eyes
in the distance. I saw him very near.</p>

<p>Horses. Why are horses blind. They are in one eye.</p>

<p>What does a lizard want to get. He wants to get
Polybe. Who will train him, who will wash him. Who
is beside him. Where is he. We do not know.</p>

<p>Cook is such a believer in parent's age. He says it
all the time he is certainly or thirteen or fourteen plus
seventeen. I mean it. I think he is older. We never
hear about Belmonte.</p>

<p>When they gave a dinner the other day Belmonte
was not there.</p>

<p>Plan this. You meant to walk up to the horse kneeling
on one knee throw your weight on the barrier and
relieve the attack relieve it by planting sharp stars into
his shoulder relieve it by stroking the horn, by hurrying.
This was the plan and he did it again. He continued
to assure the attack by not being quick. He was very
quick. This is the way to pursue it. Follow it about
and have the understanding with the uncertainty.
Nothing is uncertain to him. He is a wretch. We can
be angry. We were disappointed Belmonte was not there
and we had paid as if he were.</p>

<p>I remember long dashes. Mr. Kitchener said that
he was to go and he would meet him. Mr. Potter he
said if you will go later I will be there. Mr. Potter did
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_74" title="74"> </a>not go or he would not have met him. Mr. Kitchener
did not go neither did Mr. Potter. Belmonte had his
foot hurt. He is still in the hospital.</p>

<p>They were here to eat their dinner. They ate their
dinner and they advised us to get <ins title="seaweed">sea-weed</ins>. They said
seaweed. He said seaweed contains iodine which is very
important for medicine. It is very important in medicine.
Belmonte uses it for his foot. He uses it to put on his
foot. Belmonte uses it on his hurt foot. It is put on his
foot a great deal. They use it often. They use it on his
foot whenever he is hurt. He has been hurt.</p>

<p>Belmonte was hurt. His foot was not hurt. It was
just above his foot and there he was seriously hurt.</p>

<p>Necessarily the secret of Belmonte. I do not wish
to weep. I forget war and fear and courage and dancing.
I forget standing and refusing. I believe choices. I
choose Gallo. He is a cock. He moves plainly.</p>

<h2><a name="ENGLAND">ENGLAND</a></h2></div>


<p>Leave off more time than the hope which assures the
rent of a custom, the sweetness is not only there it is the
reason left and monkeys are not merry. If you do have
the eyes blue and the hair the color then it is easy to see
the hands.</p>

<p>All along and the day, the prize is not driven and
the selecting of all the coal is that.</p>

<p>All the while is light and cleaning is not repetition.
If you see the chance then spring again and if not be
extreme, be certain that the show has that line in line
and do not, never, see the patent desert the measles.</p>

<p>So the cloth is alright and the carpet is English.
Pink and the moon, that sweet sugar is brown.</p>

<p>Cane sour asparagus and do not season with reason.
Certainly the union of oxygen with ostriches is not that
of the taught tracer. It is not a window that has an
elastic it is planted gutta percha.</p>

<p>The change is not plain seeking, the hills are not
dislocated and the cluster has not the name of the
intermediate beginning.</p>

<p>To paste more attention on a bridge is not the path
that is taken. All of it is planted. The blossom is
pealing, the tender dew is green, the presence is in the
time in between, the sacrifice is that that the bell which
rings has a clapper. The pleasure in the use is not so
dreary but that there is an exchange.</p>

<p>One sees a custom, one sees a date, one sees a
potatoe, one sees a caterpillar, one sees more particulars
than kissing, one sees the blame distributed, one sees
more than any one.</p>

<p>Powder and food, union and despatch, so that there
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_83" title="83"> </a>is no pale color, so that there is black, so that there is
much preperation of a return to the same.</p>

<p>If a little meadow and a tree have that use and a
morning and the west wind have that use and the evening
and the continuation have that use then there is no use
when the sing song ends rising.</p>

<p>Yes there is the same. There is all of that which
makes it certain that something is what is there and not
misplaced. This means that to be different there is not
any place that is the same and if the whole place is there
then it is not alarming it is confirming. This is so
shrewdly what is proven.</p>

<p>Bailing the center of a spot and not having an
embankment is not the only way to flirt. So soon, so
left without a spoon, so august and so strange and taller
than every other, it is not astonishing that some one is
older.</p>

<p>There is not a seed and an orange. An orange is red
and yellow. A seed has only a little way to grow and
there is not any palm that grows larger. It is the same.
It is astonishing, it is the same. The sweet spread
of the union with intuition and every anger is so certain
that there is no bloom. There is red feeling and the
color is deeper. Blue is of some use. There is more
place for weather.</p>

<p>A pigeon is a bird and flying it is not widening the
piece that cooking makes duller, not at all, it does not
taste that way.</p>

<p>The cause and any effect this does not make the smell
stronger, this does not make what is pie.</p>

<p>To change any sigh, then to place all of that hope,
to destroy dancing and to make a lovely turn that is not
the season of every day, that is not the season of Monday,
that is not the season of Sunday.</p>

<p>A pleasant taste and plenty of butter, a pleasant
drink and plenty of water, tea and more fruit than in
winter, bread and more eaten than ever this is so sad
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_84" title="84"> </a>and every one sees that it is to be cheerful. Any one
sees cheerful weather, every one eats cheerful potatoes,
they are large and there is water and there is butter, a
whole city is not subdued it is iniquitous, it is so soon
to see the plant that is not buried showing more white
tail than ever. A little thing is never tender. The size
is there.</p>

<p>In the moan where there is no groan, in the noise
where there is no presence, in the palm where there is the
range of the seed and the light of more, in the room
where there is all there the place where there is every
chair, in the hall where there is steam-heat all about
there is union in the height of some. So then there is
no prayer where the use is more strange than none. This
does not make for cheese and the rest are the same every
day.</p>

<p>Butter which is every where has a little table, fish
is all the time of day when the silver is away and there
is more there. All the daylight makes for meat
and the washing has that price, every price is cheaper.
All the finished way to treat everything there is to place
is not the only way to shape the standing heating. All
the day is every day and exercise is made that way and
piling plates where there is grass is something that is
neater. To originate a smash means more tasting than
there is when there is no use in stewing more than has
been put in there to stay. So comes more length and
some more weight and the bestowal of that piece is not
astonishing.</p>

<p>The lantern of blinking is not lively and this is distracted
by quick ways of winking. There is so much
use. The line of the rise is afternoon sunrise.</p>

<p>So the main is seen and the green is green. Pleasure
the rotten winter when there is a rotten summer. There
are some things a place can not show.</p>

<p>So there is no end to a name and there is no end of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_85" title="85"> </a>likelihood. A darling makes no noise and a spoon makes
nothing pink.</p>

<p>Return the whole special short sentence and then
say that he will be pleased. To say that in that result
is so much more particular. The cleanliness comes from
washing the little pieces at the center and not making
them have the sparkle in black. This is not all of a windy
day. So much more that is green and not gold makes the
bottom have that form. The shapes are there. They
are not there when they are the same. A reason is given.
It has a whole name.</p>

<p>Soon the Susan is all past, the land is clean and the
green color is not singled with more yellow than some.
This shows in the catalogue and in the hair.</p>

<p>All the plate is glass and cleaned with white which
are hanging, the whole is spent and there is more than
the size.</p>

<p>All the long way to be in that length which makes
no more of some cuckoo is not shown by the intermission
of every reply. It is so cheerful and the breath which
is not all of a response is used some more. There is a
sound that came and made the agreeable deplacement of
no sign. If it is to be had there is a way to surround
the time of day. The sooner sand is not the smell of
heating and this more ancient than the day does not mean
all the noon.</p>

<p>He can be pleased in the same time as a bright
Sunday. He can be dancing so. He can be and he is
somewhat. He is altogether.</p>

<p>He and there are the patience, he and all the whole
way is uplifted with that and surely the simple thing is
to neglect that and to do so.</p>

<p>Soon to have an eye, soon to have plenty of them,
soon to have a nose, soon to have plenty of them, soon
to have a light soon to have plenty of them.</p>

<p>The argument is that if there is a way there is no
need to say that separation means more use than all the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_86" title="86"> </a>cake. That is true, that is a belief. A thorough substance
is one that has no particular caterpillar, a caterpillar has
no color, this is no loss, there is no less more than there
is clothing, it shows that much and anybody can say no,
anybody has a hat, a hat has no use, that does not mean
that it does shine when there is a plain sight.</p>

<p>All the heavy weight is that color and nobody is more
famous than an oaken piece of wood, not any body and
every one is famous, every one, when there is no lavender.</p>

<p>Peace to more calm, and rest to more regret that
selling is not burdening buying.</p>

<p>Still so many change, the time to say that the change
is not a meadow is not to all the same and anyway all have
nothing bare. They season their chocolate, they partake
tender, the rest is the finish of the street, the houses are
adjusted and adjoining. The conclusion is no veil, the
breeze is taller and surely walking is something, there
is any occasion, there is no pink appurtenance, so much
suit, so much harbor, so much that is described in
response.</p>

<p>A land is not more seen than a beefsteak and a
beefsteak is wasted. All the roast has a sale and all
sale is varnish. The section that has the twin set of
notwithstanding are all suited with the linen, and more
camps are made to fit than there is hair on a peninsular.
The reason is so just that a question has that right and
a belief is universal that is to say there is no doubt of
something.</p>

<p>Drafts are not dark nor is the sea and livelier are the
seven months of warning. All the perils are serene, and
laughing is not stranger.</p>

<p>Piling for a witness means the boat and all the
floating places are so searched, tighter and more of the
breathing there makes any swelling so much simpler.</p>

<p>A plain tie makes a connection on Saturday and they
are the first. They have that reason, no one can oppose
visiting, there is no use in obtaining a station. Time
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_87" title="87"> </a>to go away is October. That shows more winter than
weather. This does make a written reason.</p>

<p>A bloom on a red thing means that there is a single
country. An apple offered means that there is no disgrace.
A single thing that has no seeds means that there
is land. A same joint and no appetite means that there
are no sandwiches.</p>

<p>Like the mantle and the light and the crackling
underwear, like the colors that are dark and the mixtures
that are bright, like them all there is no destruction, there
is no analogy, there is a dislocation, there is no disturbance.</p>

<p>Startling and true the same are few. The presence
of many is acute. The death of more is arduous. The
relation of all that is in that language. So simple a date
makes no hard singing. If it is a wild cow it is tame.
The single hair shows the reason in a precise ham. It
is a dinner. It is leaning.</p>

<p>Kindling is wood and coal is tonny. That is the
blame and a blower is funny. The time comes to state
that. There is seriousness.</p>

<p>Blame is not forecast it is a sunrise, how soon is
there more shade than light.</p>

<p>A bang is the sound of water, a simple string ties
it together. It is so struck that there is water, moisture
has a sample of more. There is no sympathy. There
is no educator. If the width is more the wider is wider.
The width is not a wayside it is the block. There is
the color soon. There is no shade. Shadows are a
sampler. There is no sampler. The width is precious.
It is wading in length. The wide angel has no wet winter.
It is not drained wetter.</p>

<p>Bursting no more and being the sample of more of
it is not so much simpler than it was. It was so sudden.
It was suddenly so much more safer. Then there came
the same time and there is analysis, there is the whole
time and there is no more simplification than there is.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_88" title="88"> </a>There is very much more. There is that there. There
is there more than that. There is.</p>

<p>To avoid a shot means that there is no way to jump.
Why should an engagement fit two. There is no cause
in despair. The darkness that makes a mind show dirt
is that which is practical. The union of all that is
wetness, the change is underweight and yet the practical
use of length is the same as width. There is that belief.</p>

<p>Ink is black. That is brutal if there are fish.</p>

<p>A church is so enchanted that there is hymning.
This makes the question safer.</p>

<p>All the peals that were ruined were those that were
stumbling and if these were in the way they were a shop.
That means that selling is an obligation.</p>

<p>A clamp is that which when attached has a pin.
This keeps it from coming more to say less. This does
not show wagering. If the time is between then there
is no certain wisdom and yet there is no denial. Why
should there be. What is the taste. It is not so painful
to see hanging. Hunger is more perforated. That does
not mean that there is a change in weight.</p>

<p>No powder, pink is not a color, any color is an order
that is to say if a window is not the same every one has
that resemblance. Saving no soap and coming in, coming
right in means that there is that action. The tone of
surprise is uplifting but there is not that disgrace, there
is down, that is sinking. Coming in, that is coming and
rinsing, that which is used is the room, that which is used
is washing, that which is used is not preventing anything
resembling any soaking. So much substance, so much
receipt, so many more cakes of wintry dancing. Is it
astonishing. It is. There is every disturbance. Why is
there whether. Why is the Thames warmer.</p>

<p>Packing and not mentioning being adjoining does not
mean eye-sight. It does not mean a release from an
operation. It is not destroying a button.</p>

<p>So then the price is the same and the size is dependent
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_89" title="89"> </a>on the whole piece. It shows no holes clearly.
There is no use in scissors.</p>

<p>A kind of wading is not so poisonous as wiped water.
The length of a street is not disturbed by the use of
slippers. Not at all.</p>

<p>Loud and not louder and the time is stouter and the
width is wider and the selection is thicker. No time to
be tall and small no time to prick a finger, no time to
surprise a noise in the sides and yet all that is used by
there being more time there every birthday. Every birthday
which is not yesterday has an occupation. An occupation
is that which when there is the time shows the
center of that which is the lamentation and lamenting
does not destroy that use, it does not fulfill a judgement,
it does more, it is relined. The same shows more when
there is no date. Any reading is simple. The use is all
day. A response uses words. They mean that full.
The length is more than the joining. There is that reestablishment
and no violence. The time is more so than
peculiar. There is nothing to see. Reading is action.
There is a swim in a way. All the time is an accident.
There is a reason. There is that experience of detraction.
There there is expression, there is a blame not intending
disturbing unattaching unintelligent attention to extreme
intention.</p>

<p>Payment and subjoining sin, the length of death is
not between, the tooth and the age and more than all,
the salt, and more than all also the hard bed and no
petition. There is the use in pointing harder than no wind
and no other.</p>

<p>This is not white, there is no cream any kind color,
there is the time to grow longer and all the same if there
is no paper it does not show in the print and pen-wiper.
It does not.</p>

<p>It can see more than what, than then. Henry and
a doleful danger. There is a sending of a principle line
of unpointed apples, and a target, a whole thing is no
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_90" title="90"> </a>example. And the caneseat joint is so soundless in quiet
cushions. There is no more pen-wiper.</p>

<p>Anything that is everything and everything that is
anywhere and everything that is everywhere has no
special singular purpose. If purpose is intellectual then
there is a garden, if there is a garden there is a fountain,
if there is a fountain then there is an intellectual purpose.
No respect is resembling that more than the mischief.</p>

<p>To choose more is to choose something. That choice
which is admonished is not more dated than that which
is remembered and there is a fine display of zeal there
certainly is and nothing is more orderly nothing and when
there is washing there is interlacing. This means so much
cleaning and cleaning which has that sign is the same as
the whole time of being peculiar.</p>

<p>Any one is older. Any one is a sight for a beholder.
Any one is saved a sickness. And any one is a particular
substitute for remaining undetermined and seeing a clean
collar. All the same the full service is in the height of
a rich thick sandy sticky silence. There is no dispute
when there is harmony. All the date is in the place.
There are such red ones when they are pretty. A color
which shows is one that is not seen anywhere. This will
happen. This does not start a subject.</p>

<p>To be reckless and rejoined, to be sad and not forsaken,
to be earnest and awake, to be sure that there is
freedom, all this makes no difference at all. A sight that
disturbed was not that after all there was restraint and
to look differently shows that there is a resemblance and
that the nation has partaken. The nation has partaken
and there is no pleasanter reunion.</p>

<p>To be forced to say that there is no denial, not to
be forced but to be rejoiced that comes from the time
when there is no hesitation and much ease. Very much
ease is more ease than much ease, much ease is more ease
than the ease which is not that ease. That comes to be
said. That comes to be so said that there is no individual
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_91" title="91"> </a>reunion between the first second third fourth and fifth.</p>

<p>A cause for disturbance rests in the fact that more
time is used in a long time than in a short time. There
is no criticism when the time is long. The time is so
long that an answer comes promptly. This is so much
the more satisfactory as the occasion for an answer is
whenever there is cause for a question. The difference
between this and no elaboration is extreme. No elaboration
is not achieved in a question nor in an answer and
this which is so eminently satisfactory is that there is no
doubt that there will be no reason for the occasion. To
be faithful is to be accustomed and the custom which is
without that reservation has no circumstance to replace
it. The time to state that is when there is no reason to
doubt a result. There never is a reason to doubt a result
if there is a promise. If there is a promise it means that
idleness is only another name for a thing.</p>

<p>The whole place is so large that there is no dust and
so there not being that there is every occasion for no
difference to be noticeable. This makes reading so
necessary.</p>

<p>Nothing is perplexing if there is an island. The
special sign of this is in dusting. It then extends itself
and as there is no destruction it remains a principle. This
which makes that reveals that and revelation is not fortuitous
it is combined and ordered and a bargain. All
this shows the condition to be erect. Suppose that there
is no question, if there is no question then certainly the
absence of no particular is not designed. And then when
it is astonishing it is not liberty. Liberty is that which
gathered together is not disturbed by distribution and not
given without remark and not disturbed by frugality and
an outline. All this makes the impression that is so disturbed
that there is no question.</p>

<p>There is no use in denying what any one hearing
reading is hearing, there is no use and doing it every day
is not tantalising, it is not a bit more tantalising than
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_92" title="92"> </a>exaggeration, not a bit and the whole result is spoken out
in the best time and place and moment. This increases
daily and all the time what if there is meddling, meddling
is not automatic, and if it is automatic why should it not
be obligatory.</p>

<p>A candle light does not mean that there are candles,
a candle light means arithmetic and training and ways of
stating a question and it means much more, it means that
every night if there is moonlight there is that light, and
light has so much place in a lighted place that every one
is accustomed to it.</p>

<p>It is so wintry and hair is blowing and all the slippery
slides have water on them, it is so summery and wind is
water and all that is red is what is burning, the whole
excitement, all the wedding shows the spring to be the
place where water springs, all the horizon, all the dwelling
shows that escaping is not an escapade that is in a suggestion.
So to reason and so to eclipse and so to redden
the western sun, so to accept and so to annoy and so to
have no piece of money, so much so is not a tangible
substance, it is intangible and therefore it is sliced.</p>

<p>A toil that has no frozen dish-water, a trembling that
has an appetite, a refusal that has a nervous extremity,
an expression that has a direction of disregarding, all this
shows the essential use of a minority, they show it and
they caution it, they do not outrage giving it credit. The
time does not come to any one who is pardoned, it comes
and then when there is patience when there is use, when
there is talking and a table, when there is even a slice of
ham, it comes then to be announced that certainly understanding
is what is not partial, it is so kind and strong and
lengthy that certainly there is no disgrace.</p>

<p>A goose girl is no goose girl when there are geese.
A church is a church. A ship is a ship. Thunder is
thunder.</p>

<p>Silence which makes silence give that sense to all
there is, silence which has light and water and unison and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_93" title="93"> </a>appetite and result and a motion and more exaggeration
and no recklessness, silence which is there is not disturbed
by expression.</p>

<p>There is no doubt of one thing there is no doubt that
the real rate of establishing frequency is that which is
used when there are numbers.</p>

<p>What comes out of silence. What comes out of
silence is that which having that usefulness, that nature,
and that fashion is not shown to be managed by the
combination.</p>

<p>Surely silence is sustained and the change is sudden.</p>

<p>Supposing that there was no use for that which there
is use for, supposing there was a bridge there where there
is what there is, supposing all this and suppose that the
enlightenment of everybody consisted in everybody having
that condition, supposing all this, this is then the answer
that silence gives in answer. The silence that is not preserved,
the silence is the same as the characteristic which
is not finished.</p>

<p>A pound of paper and no more string, a pound of
string and no more leather, no pounds of anything else,
does that make indifference, it does, it does make authority.
All the calamity that shows origin and design is
that which when it is understood is redetermined all this
is entitled readministration. There is no use in a pencil,
there is no use in any direction of succeeding in experience,
there is not one single objection. The wholesale
cloth is not handled with a sprinkler, it is so handled that
when there is no obligation there is every inducement it
is so handled that pathways are mended, it is so handled
that there is a single sound. All the same there is no such
language, it does not mean by that that the letters are
smaller it does not mean that at all.</p>

<p>The strength of purpose which joins resignation with
neglect and action with reducing and interpretation with
resignation, the strength of purpose which connects distribution
with desertion, and pink coloring with bathing,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_94" title="94"> </a>the strength of purpose which does not deny reddening,
which does not authorize forbidding which does not disturb
utilizing, the strength of purpose which adjusts desertion
and exercise and resolution, the strength of
purpose which organizes recognition and the disturbing
of a perfectly satisfactory reception, the strength of
purpose that withdraws no application and registers no
reaction and suggests no opening, such a strength of
purpose is resolute and reliant and reëstablished, such a
strength of purpose has the same service as the expression
of recognition, such a strength of purpose has the borrowing
of relaxation and the neglect of retardation, such a
strength of purpose is selected selecting articles for recollecting,
such a strength of purpose has origin and
unison, such a strength of purpose has the surface of
differentiation, such a strength of purpose has the organ
of rehabilitation, such a strength of purpose is not pasting,
it is not nailing, it is not swinging, it is not fighting, it is
not saving, it is not utilizing the origin of sewing, all the
same the strength of purpose is something, it is there, it
is worried, it is in the precise situation that nothing shows,
it is displaced, it is practiced, it even has a little place to
spread a certain kind of preparation, it even is the kind
of thing that has celebrations and bursts and specks and
a kind of thing that has no particular name but is useful
when it is not used in the end, in every way there is
adaptation and that does not mean the same as the use of
no excuse it means something that any one can see is
opposite, it means what is coming to be realized as the
intended metal to make nothing of and not be wasted.
All the same there is that idea and if there are no more
pieces why then there is a difference, there is a kind of
way of saying that, there is no doubt that any one can
join in with some member and surely if the rest makes
no matter what is there any use to say there is no difference.
There is none and so the whole thing shows that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_95" title="95"> </a>there is no pot and no dirty winter, all the same it does
sound that way.</p>

<p>The shed and the house and any shelter shows mud in
winter, it does and it shows in summer as well, it shows
it in summer and in winter and it shows so well that anybody
says something different, anybody shows something
when something is showing, and something is showing
whenever there is sauce and there always is that to save
and put around. There always is some way to be reconciled
to a difference. The whole thing is just shown in
their being no celebrated invalid.</p>

<p>Keep away and visit every Saturday. That is the
only way to resist carrying all the attention when there
is enough time. Time is not the thing any evening.
Time is not the thing in the afternoon. There is not such
a morning.</p>

<p>Not a time when there is occupation not such a time
is the time that is not used and a knock that has no intention
has some hope. It is not open to stay. There is a
way to go away. That is not the use of that way. There
is every return.</p>

<p>That which is not used is not a word it is enough.
That which is asked is not a conversation, it is a piece of
typewriting. And so there is no choice and yet if there
were not would there be the exchange of everything.
There is enough of that which is admitted often and sometimes
to make any difference there comes to be of returning
receiving. This is not what is kindly.</p>

<p>To keep on is to use what there is when there is
enough of what is in daily use. That is not the medium
that has that renewal.</p>

<p>It was the time of day to fill all day. The steadiness
of that and that which is useful is the thing that is individual
and a refusal to sing is one thing, to go on with a
song is not wrong, to say that a use is not passed away
when what is not said is not useful is one way to say that
the quality that is the same has any experience.</p>

<p>Winter in a room and living there and many rooms
and some air and all the same breath when food is not
scarce and enough to eat if boiling is neat, all of that
which does not pass away stays to place the work that
has that presentation.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_98" title="98"> </a>
It was not dark and the light was not lost as that
which was finishing the condition was the same if it was
wood. It had not the same description. There are ways
of admiring something.</p>

<p>There is a regular way of having that position that
entering is not permission if there is no need of question.
All the time that the talk is done there is a way to stay.
To use anything is not the best way to have the right
answer. All of the time is so placed that an awkwardness
does not mean a pleasant entrance and there is the
presence of that which is not necessary which induces
a reception.</p>

<p>There is no dreariness in success and selling a picture
and arranging an exhibition. There is no dreariness in
four galleries and five cities and a packer. There is no
dreariness in charging a direction and using up a special
expression and seeing that sustain reorganisation. There
is no dreariness in having some reception. There is no
dreariness.</p>

<p>The time has come when seeing a different coat reminds
some one of the time of the year and this does
not make the same difference as a strong nature. This
makes the particular use of some understanding and loss
of hope and change of face. This does mean that the
pleasant time has been near.</p>

<p>A darker day is not darker and the reason of that
is that the impression being made it is continued until
there is that change and the change is not coming, it has
not that complexion.</p>

<p>The whole time is occupied when there is no place
where the effect of that impression is not wearing into
some shape and then when the copy is not perfect it is
not prettier and the thing to show is the intention and the
way to spend the whole piece is to move away and explain
that in a letter. If there is a faithful action then belief
is certain if there is no change of reputation. All that is
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_99" title="99"> </a>received is answered when any subject is open and there
is no place to sit and talk.</p>

<p>There is a way to say that the thing there is not in
the square and when it is in the square if it is there then
seeing it is enough if going into it is to be put there and
there is a way to go in, the way to go out is if it is the
same is the same. The whole of that time is not used
when a little thing that remains has no meaning. Any
little thing has that meaning. There is another way of
being a dirty fellow.</p>

<p>If the effect of a defect is to allure and to change
the base of any recognition then it is a wonderful way
that makes a vision and that is what is if no one is the
same and the one is only that one and is not any different.
It has not any meaning that which is so plain that a screen
keeps nothing clean. The air is not there. If there is
no surface then the only way to choose is by example
and there is not a way to compliment, there is a way to
try any way and to have had no resolution and to have
been received by some. To come into the relation means
that if there is a response something has been said. This
is not too exact. It does not exhaust a preparation.</p>

<p>Not lading the leaning and not exhilerating the creation
and the tending of the flowering is practically all of
that thing. Arranging the renewal of refusing by accepting
is the only sweetness succeeding is not subduing.
Succeeding is not staggering when it is not proceeding
and the best plan is the day that has less provision. The
whole place is one place and the place that is that place
is the place where the hope is that which has no time.
The only withdrawing of nothing that has longing is the
time that it takes to say that there is joining.</p>

<p>Arrive and wait and say to no other that there is no
deception when there is relaxation. Not to say anything
is obliging.</p>

<p>To have that position and to meet that destination
and to show the way which is not changed as a pleasant
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_100" title="100"> </a>greeting and that reception is all there is of all reunion.
It does not copy the relation and it does have that movement.</p>

<p>To see no harm and to see all the charm and to have
possession and to defend permission if there is any way
to ask it is to despise one another if there is the same
reason. What can be used if all that is held is supported
by everything. What can be some change. The whole
place is there to see and to go there means that the same
thing is begun. The regard is different.</p>

<p>Leading in hearing, that is to be tired, that is what
is the way to hear more and always then there is that
result, there is a change. Leading in hearing and then
that is being tired and being then staying and being remaining
and exchanging that for that thing.</p>

<p>Not feeding eating, that is eating in feeding, eating
is what eating is and feeding is what feeding is and
eating and feeding that is the use of that receptacle which
is not empty. Nothing is empty and open and everything
is full when it is opening and closing. Closing is nothing.</p>

<p>The open way the open way and the closing way, the
open way is not the origin of that which is interesting,
the parts of speech are not the same, they have some
origin.</p>

<p>The whole place has that which it has when it is
found and it is there where there is more room. Room
has not that expression. It has no change in a place.
It is not dirty, there is no cleaner passage and the best way
to have it all express that is to cook a dinner. There is
enough to get a suit that is not had when there is no hope.
That is the difference if there is much and there is much
more.</p>

<p>To place one by the side of another and they both
have something that is their color to do that and not
languish is to look then and see that relinquish what it
will have when it remains where it is to be. This is not
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_101" title="101"> </a>foolish, it is a part of all distraction. It is the intention
of all dissension. It is the measure of all language.</p>

<p>To see that a piece is used where there is no receipt
is one way to express that things which are different
have that resemblance and this does not mean that there
is not a denial, this means that the same room is different
when the furniture is colored. To color furniture is
to say that the furniture is wider and the walls are taller
and the light is clearer. To change often is to say that
the use of something is the same.</p>

<p>To answer when there is no question, to intend to
follow when there is no plunging, to embody that which
has that knowledge, all that is the way to remain with the
little button that has a button-hole. This is so attached.</p>

<p>It is not there to squeeze that which has no meaning,
it is not there to squeeze. The order that has not been
begun is the one that sends ten away. The ten stay some
where and the time is longer. The use of it is that there
is more in any long way.</p>

<p>The distaste for cold meat does not lead to eating.
It leads to everything. This is not all of a feeling. It is
enough to suggest any little thing.</p>

<p>The way to thank is to respect the whole opening
and the way to despise one apple is to choose another.
This can be done by weighing. It can also be done by
looking.</p>

<p>The way to use a quotation is to hope that it will be
heard when it is spoken. That is the way to make that
sound.</p>

<p>It is not the same that which is not sad with that
which is repeated. It is not the same and the sight is
so different that there is that hope and no more excitement.
Then the change is there and there is all the comparison.
The rising of the wedding is not the same as
one child if there are no children but one child has that
to use and there is enough to give it a cold. This is not
seasonable. This is not the way to despair.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_102" title="102"> </a>
The heat of hearing is not the silence of answering
and nothing is produced when the question is the same as
the name. That is one way to answer and there might
have been more but it was different, it was the same.</p>

<p>The whole district was not used when a place was
borrowed and the pleasure in that union is the same as
giving permission. The hope of that intention is what
keeps the answer from being prepared and if it is prepared
then it is printed. There is enough intermission.</p>

<p>To cause a special heat and to be colder is not the
way of having any custom. There is no irregularity in
that. It is too plain. The time for that grief is not in
the head it is in the origin of salvation. So there has
come to be no neglect and there does not waste any order
when the time which is all day is the same time and if
not older then not that difference in spending. It is not
all the same if nothing is spent. It is not all the same
because then there are all the things there that have come
to be gotten by searching and finding something. This
which happens often uses the time that is not plain to
see. It is not so discouraging and the whole thing is not
so full as it would be if there was not another. The
resemblance is there.</p>

<p>There is no paint when there is nothing to dirty.
There is never any change in that and the silence is not
there when it is empty and there is no intention to show
more than enough. All the time there is the exact way
of changing it a little and not mixing more and that is
not the origin of industry, the origin of industry is the
evening of recitation. There is some past playing of
singing every past evening. This is not more than the
future.</p>

<p>A pleasing way to use a broom is to lean upon the
wall and not do more than make any one who is the one
welcome. This if it is pleasing is pleasing and working
is industry. That does not change everything. Intending
to remove the dirt does not destroy the variegated color.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_103" title="103"> </a>The color is not a stain. It shows what glass is when
there is a reflection. This peaceable pursuit is so earnest
and so steady that there is no remark made when all the
time there is that description and the way is that way as
there is what is said as the way that is that way. The
door is not so open.</p>

<p>It was not dark and the weather was not clear and
the sunshine was not gloomy and the color was not red,
it was not dusty and the window was not open and the
stove was not shut and the table was set. There was no
pepper and there was some salt and there was more
chicken and there was more sweet. There was cauliflower
and there was cake and there was no steamer and
there was butter and there was potato and there was
cucumber. There was no cream and there was banana
and there was cream later and there was orange mixture.
All the potato that was eaten had been roasted and the
pigeons were kept and the fruit was finished and there
was another platter.</p>

<p>All the time is dark and there is a light and the time
to think is the time to paint and the grey blue purple is
the red rose color and the pink white cover is the fine
broken china. The object of more is to stay that way
and the use of the present is to mingle that future and the
presence of all is the use of that and the pleasure of that
date is to separate in weight. The time to express is to
receive that attention and the change in tone is not the
disgust. The dwindling of more is not to show that wear,
the spring of the change is the loosening of that. The
mingling of this is not the spurt and the winning of the
white is not the soiling of the black. The tin that presses
has not a hollow sound and the color blue is not so pure
and true. The best of all is the presence of the best and
the way to stay is to sit long in that way. No way to stay
is a way to go away. No way is a way. No way <ins title="is a">is</ins> way.
There is enough to sound the note and the little flute is
there where there is no air and the blowing is strong
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_104" title="104"> </a>and the blowing is long and the air is there where there
is no air. Solemnly to stay is not a sad way. To stay
away is not the glory of that day. To begin the time
is not the time to dim the evening and enough decision has
no origin. This is that result.</p>

<p>Labor and not long makes a sad song and that is not
true when the name is short and the preparation is the
same. There was a particular time of day to hope more
and this was not all of the morning and the evening and
the beginning of the afternoon. This was after finishing
a piece of the copying that gives splendor to any situation
and this was also the time when having stayed long
enough there was no more explanation. All the best
permission lies in correspondence and more permission
is not used when there is no distance. This does not
disentangle vice. This makes a season last longer and the
cold weather which is not such very cold weather has the
happiness of expecting to rain. This does not warrant
all that intention.</p>

<p>In the time to wait and tell the truth there is no
more dispute than if there had been more time. This
does show the antiquity of acknowledging that a morning
is used for something. To deny that is to deny everything
and to determine that would need no hesitation.
This is not what there is to think. This is more of the
presence of witnesses.</p>

<p>This which is assured would make the nervous one
not so worried when the answer is not coming. A great
many risks need that advice. A dash of the following is
so distinct and the time to send more is what is not
hopeless. All the time and all the date and all the superfluous
wood and porcelain show the mark and the use and
the continuation of retention.</p>

<p>Patience is not plenty and waiting is not abusing the
intention. Any little thing is more than a question. Any
attempt is a return of a permission. To be attentive and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_105" title="105"> </a>intended and make that mistake is not more deceptive
than anything.</p>

<p>Present the detachment and have the words continue
to come there and this will not make a tune slower and
destroyed, this will not at all be that. To put that question
does not mean the mention of an author. To repeat
the name is not the same when there is no chair. To draw
it in is one way to approach the place that was not there
to intrude. This does not make the objection clearer it
just makes the same tune.</p>

<p>It was thought that as the mountain of something
which does not grow does not grow, it was once thought,
it was thought that the change was not so old and the
age was older. It was thought that the same thing pressed
would be put on there where there was no custom. It
was thought that there would be some more age. It was
intended and there was that which was earnest, it was
intended that the obligation which was not climbing would
lead to the showing of anything and it was there where
there was hope that the time was. The whole thing was
not the same.</p>

<p>To open a door and turn in the direction that the
one entering will bow shows so little quick movement that
there is a way to advance. And so to be timely, to have
that hesitation, to bring a chair up and to enter into
standing does not occupy the whole evening if there is
some singing.</p>

<p>That is settled that which needs some introduction.
It is not necessary to refuse it. Any evening there is
more hesitation. Any thickening of the coat shows something
and there is a use of that word.</p>

<p>It was all right, there was that hesitation, there was
the time of the afternoon and there was one evening of
some which were those which were evenings. There was
that and the best way to show that is to have more than
each little piece not used as a question. This can commence
that. There is no perplexity, there is that abuse,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_106" title="106"> </a>there is more, there is something. There is no bit of
more than was used by any writing. There can be more
printing. There can be intending lending. There can be
that interest.</p>

<p>A peculiarity of the steps and the entrance is that
it is not so peculiar as there are more calling out something.
This would change a beginning if there had not
been a setting. This which was was the time to do that
and the result is different.</p>

<p>So the whole thing means this that if there is a
continual use of it all there can be and there is the expression
of that emotion.</p>

<p>The pleasantest anticipation is that reaction and more
time is then spent and the whole place is lonely. There
are four in it.</p>

<p>If the cleverness of that copy means that a voice is
louder then certainly there is not that connection that
there is as there is what has been lasting. This is not
so dirty. Cold water is not cleaner.</p>

<p>Pound the little time-table and then spread it so that
reading it is not any more simple than it was. This has
that charm and every little quality has that intensity.
It is not more distinguished to be whiter than to be redder,
to be taller than to be shorter. The meaning has more
necessity.</p>

<p>A beaming expression does not mean that the eye
is so clear that there is no fatigue.</p>

<p>The drag that keeps that important is not spread out.
This is a reason why if that which is left to do is done
there is no admission. All the same there could be more
if the direction was necessary and it is so full that there
is always that hope and that room.</p>

<p>Blessed are the patient particulars manifesting that
hesitation so that when there is no hope there is always
a guide. In the languages that one used and sung some
words are longer than others and this has so much seasoning
and so strong a fence that certainly the tangle is not
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_107" title="107"> </a>made by more than the three words that come being
divided by there being no more. This does take the time.</p>

<p>All the beginning has that intelligence and certainly
a useful time to make requests is when there are any
addresses and there are always addresses in places. This
does mean that need and that use and that return and that
plentiful remorse. There is so much to say.</p>

<p>A timidity that has no use in a boast is not that which
tells about drawing. The continuance of that is not more
than promised, it is continued.</p>

<p>To have the land behind when there is no sea has
that to do which is not settling that which is more than
free. It is so natural that the opinion is there.</p>

<p>To detail more is to ask that question, it is to refuse
to answer, it is to add that to it. That is some excuse
and more would not be enough and certainly that way is
that authority. To control the time is where there is an
impression.</p>

<p>About the time when a book is borrowed is the time
to return it and leave it. This makes any one having that
light not need to put it where it is to be put.</p>

<p>Adding any more to a change is to occupy what is
offended and the refusal to go together may mean that.
This when there is a song does not make a choice depend
upon meaning.</p>

<p>That rising and falling which singing is doing means
that drawing a chair closer can be repeated. This would
be more than that interruption. There is no place for
that time.</p>

<p>To sweeten a lucky star means that a sad way to
sweep together the leavings is the one way to continue
favor. And that which is most active is more active
as industry has that meaning. It has. It has that
meaning.</p>

<p>The surplus weight is inside and when it is put into
the pockets it is not heavier, this gives some feeling of
not lingering. The authority that makes that lonesome
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_108" title="108"> </a>is not the same as disgust. It is always different sometime.</p>

<p>This makes an attempt more tedious than it would
be if the change were coming and the presence of that is
some little quality. There can be agreement and the
spectacle is the same.</p>

<p>Then this which is not too much is often and so there
comes to be that time and certainly that which was spent
was not wasted as waste has not that meaning.</p>

<p>So there is no empty place. All the time the chairs
are there and there are enough tables. Wood has not
that meaning.</p>

<p>This is not a slice and all the juice that is dry is
not so dry when the hair and all is fair. This does not
make a greeting any less pleasing and certainly that which
is done is not so discouraging. There is no hope to use.</p>

<p>Paint the little piece of wood more and there is no
way to know that which is sore. This does not mean
more rarity than an exception. This does not displace
waiting for a wedding.</p>

<p>To ponder and not plaster any section is so long to
stay in the house where the meals are given if there is
food provision that enough of it means something. It
does not mean a color in a symptom. That is not the
only way to hope.</p>

<p>See Thomas bring the grain, see the grain have the
color that grain has when grain is growing in any winter
which is any summer. See Thomas bring the rain and see
that the thunder is not the thunder that any rain raining
longer is having thunder when having thunder. See
Thomas bring what Thomas is bringing and the load is
not lighter as Thomas turns the shadow darker. Thomas
has no spring of water, Thomas has the color brighter.
Thomas is the time to stay. Thomas hears what any
source can supply. Thomas not darkly not lightly,
Thomas does the chamber over.</p>

<p>The ruling of the pencil and the farm, the ruling
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_109" title="109"> </a>of a shadow and the grain, the ruling of the woman who
gave away what was not there to stay, any ruling is the
same and the line is there and has that prospect.</p>

<p>So closely was it passed that there was not more
space than there was and so sweet are the pleasures of
the rest that a quarrel with a cousin has the same result.</p>

<p>Pass it on to the bottle, houses in the corner have
shutters, a little tree is not lonesome because the leaves
are not bright.</p>

<p>The presence of the necessary question does not
mean that a kiss is to be given. The sweetening of
chicken is not all that is remembered when the form was
such that buttons were plentiful and the surroundings
were there. That was not any way to say that the change
was the same.</p>

<p>All the long expression that means a longer state of
natural example is not so pardonable as everything that
is in some instant. The back and the waist and the presence
of not any splinter, the sundown and the kitchen
and a table with a window and a napkin ring in winter,
all the presence of the most, all the longing of that
summer, a pleasure and a sign and there is no chance to
refuse any chair.</p>

<p>To the rug that has that hole and that color, to the
wood that has that color and that white, to the table that
has that carpet and that erection, to the bed that has that
shade and that carving, to the lantern that has that light
and that cover, to the shapes that have that decoration
and that derivation, to the floor that has that surface and
that meaning, to that light that has that look and that
garden, to that wall that has that line and that concentration,
to the best that has that choice and that color to
all and there is something sounding, to that and there is
no witness signing, to more and the explanation is not a
mistake, to less and the time is when there is that to pass,
to all the length and there is more of that then, there is
not any refusal to resist a smell.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_110" title="110"> </a>
This is not the compliance of the teeth and there is
no more force than that out loud. A plain paper is often
used.</p>

<p>Pasting nothing in a little book is the way to use
the paper and nothing is then lost and that is such a
collection. The season that weather is colder is that when
there has been that change. If all that is full has that
liquor then the time to drink is in the beginning and the
beginning has the complete return of the use of handling.
That is the kindness of September and October. All the
months that are the same have this in common.</p>

<p>To desert the red beard and to have no change of
color means that the beard is all the same age. There
can be more shaving than illumination. This does not
change every red color.</p>

<p>If the shape is the same and the use of the evening
is not much then a dress has that meaning and closing
it is not music. Something is not quiet then.</p>

<p>All right where the well is shining and the waves are
never higher than the water, cover the slipping ocean
and do not mingle more smell. See the remaining
accentuation and explain more and more and not more so.
See the rattle that was not eaten and use a pen-wiper
soon too.</p>

<p>The patent that was taken did mean more than all
the work that was spent every day in the morning. No
grief means time and no change means divorce, and no
pleasure means all eaten, and no birthday has meaning.
This which has a pain in that nose means the left when
the right is mentioned. All is not darkness when the
lights which are out are burning. The tall cat has so
much particular face that the garment is not more beautiful
than a great number. Pain and particular pleasing
pleasure and more than particular plain explaining
weather all this is more than told and a past violin is not
remaining. And yet the last little Monday is not every
Sunday and the whole cheese is not frightened and the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_111" title="111"> </a>question is not all considered and more aid engagements
were not special. All this and no more is so much more
and the language and all the kernel was the time that
solitude changed in going to another dinner. Lunch was
often.</p>

<p>To be the article of the wound and to have no purser
is not any more of a delight than is mutton. This was
so fully eaten that every day there was cooking.</p>

<p>Not that startling sage-brush, not that mortal melodrama,
not any fluent symptom, not more simple feather
sofa, not more cloud than most of the members of the
breathing place, not a joiner and not a retroactive syndicate
none of all the powder was more blue than a yellow
plant.</p>

<p>This was not that memento, this was not that parallel
syncope, this was the half curve of the splinter, this was
not every mounting, this was the perfect parliament, this
was no dope.</p>

<p>Show the place where the reproduction has that
ease and drowning has a figure. The lovely lane is not
in sight where the hair is yellow. If the change comes
sooner and there is no stroke then the time of day has
that to recommend it quite.</p>

<p>So then the platform which is not raised is occupied
and that means that if there is a meeting a delay is
offered and surely the use of that is not long when there
is no question. If there is a little quality and any quality
is that then the whole hope is so arranged that a cloth
has that short length. And so there is no excuse, there
is every mistake there is every position. An earnest protection
has some meaning and the same thing has the
charge of the place of no exchange. And still it does
happen, it has happened and there is more of that. There
is no such expression.</p>

<p>A tomb and the time is not Christmas, the time and
the way is not a carpet cover, the leather and it is not
water and the window and it is not a silk mixture,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_112" title="112"> </a>the bright season and there is a composition, all the moon
has not pain in a conglomeration.</p>

<p>There is none, there is no preceeding catastrophe,
there is no period and there is no preparation. There is
not much when all is not the same and the change has not
been indicated.</p>

<p>Why is a sour pear-tree in a blossom bee, because
it is so pleasant to remain in the summer detachment.
That is not the excuse for the box and the opening. That
is not the way to refuse that gesture. So then the union
has a widow and the mother has a father and littler and
there is no length much longer.</p>

<p>Jumping is not anything if a little way is behind the
elbow and the knee. This is the season of rejoicing and
the moment to have a denial of advice. If it is a pity
it is not the same pity as more toast. It can be so warm
that there is sunshine and it can not be what is helped
by appetite.</p>

<p>Telling the last time that a green and mixed repeater
was not lost and bought for more did not pass as it was
not told. So the beginning was made and there was some
use. They would not leave the thoughts together. This
did not make enough separation. There was still more
to behold and the time that was so frequent was any
afternoon. This came to silence any day and the single
attention was such that any candy was the same as eaten.
This was not the whole school. There was more copying
of drawing.</p>

<p>So the tune and the light was not the light of any
moon. The rain was the same and the stairs were cleaner.
There was an exchange and this did not borrow trouble.</p>

<p>Settle and there will be dinner ready, settle and
return the cake today, serve the chicken and have cream
all ready, season everything and pour the oil away, have
the salad and the cheese between, see the cream and love
the candy there, pass the day and eat the rest away, stay
away and do not shed the tear.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_113" title="113"> </a>
If a duty is so done that there is a chance let no
one who passes any way engage a room. Let them do so,
show them that direction, have the language and do not
distribute more than all of that selection, this makes
knowledge all increasing and makes the return of patient
splendor show the shadow that there is in that intention.
This is not a dream. This has the same thing as the
pleasant conversation and request. A song is not more
than necessary.</p>

<p>If the message is sent and received and if the tunes
have words then certainly there will be soon the center
piece which has not been removed. Every little flower
has a number. There is that way to question.</p>

<p>A regret with more comes when the tickets which
are not serious were written and the same time was
stated. Then there comes to be not a surprise but a
result. There is no more than any enquiry.</p>

<p>A walk is not where the door shows a light, a walk
is where there is a request to describe a description. A
walk is when a place is not to be exchanged. There is a
respect in every walk.</p>

<p>There is a result in every walk and the turn is there,
the foot and the boot have that union that there can be
slippers. Talking of the return of that shows that there
will not be an opening. There is no reason to exchange
the joke.</p>

<p>No mending, no mining, no motto, no mine, no pin,
no purchase no salad no oyster, no practice, no more, no
thought, no happy day and the best is there and there is
everywhere. Say it all in the morning, put it off in the
day, have it come in the evening, use the tune every day,
say it and please the organ, laugh and remain the same,
coughing goes by favor, and coming has a day to stay
any way some way that way.</p>

<p>Full and the tune, a shaking of the ends is not paling
in the more and then if there is no exercise there must
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_114" title="114"> </a>be that and anyhow why should there be an implacable
substitute. There is no exaggeration.</p>

<p>All and one and any place to make a gold color
show on paper, that is not the evening, that is what is
heard. Any pleasure is the one and every evening is no
matter. All this does not make that weigh more than
again. There is no patient perfume. This is not the
sign of release.</p>

<p>Blame no more than the mouth and this makes that
regulation. There is that use and there is no way and
there must be that and there shall be a disposition. That
is the sign. Any language cannot be foreign.</p>

<p>Lumber is not brick and brick is redder. The path
of a rug is that which is not returned. Enough has been
put that way.</p>

<p>Pile on more potatoes than corn-meal and more
sausage than chicken and a little more tender oil than egg
and all the eggs are fresh. So fresh and fair is no behaviour
when the whole thing has disappeared. A taste
and a branch and a sucking of the day and the calm and
the man and the noise so wettingly. This which sees that
which mourns that which colors any moon all the paste
is so straight and a scissors has a pleasing line to measure
and there is no hidden treasure.</p>

<p>See that painful delivery of a portion of more that
has squares, see it and emphasize more than any afternoon,
emphasize a special rate.</p>

<p>Please all trembling when there is a time to rise,
please it all and do nothing nicely. So serene, so much
a moon, so white and always plain, a sensation is not altered
by more being mentioned.</p>

<p>A time to stay is when there is the feeling in it and
it has been done. Why should no hope be more. Why
should it. It does show faces and if <ins title="they?">there</ins> are there one is
smaller, there is no reason why a beard should be there.
It is mostly in sight and blindness is satisfying. There
is no blindness where the talk is cheap.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_115" title="115"> </a>
Laugh the basket into a little glass and all the point
is painted. So soon is the jewel and so dirty the splinter
that any march is a distinction. There is that way. If
and there is no accusing, if the sight means that surely
the illumination is incandescent then surely something
is expected of the direction which is opposite. There is
that union and the face is there. So soon does a cork
mean closing and the belt open. This is no time to stay.
A time for splashing is not ever with a brick color. No
shaking is too great for a head. This does not mean
coming after. It means that that is never over. It means
more and it has no splinter, it does not mean samples.</p>

<p>A pale rose is a smell that has no fountain, that has
upside down the same distinction, elegance is not
coloured, the pain is there.</p>

<p>It is so clearly pleased that which is benumbed and
articulate and if in replying there is the indication of a
sentence then surely the whole thing is hurled. The house
has that patience. The story is in the evening. A single
recital makes a hat, more makes no more cloth than
pleating.</p>

<p>All the same there is silence, there is uneasiness,
there is an appetite, all the same there is silence, there is
the tune, there is the birthday. All the same any Christmas
is nearer. All the same more talk is solemn. All
the same there is a special way. All the same there is
left a pint. All the same the fruit is quince. All there
is is that shape. The return is extinguished.</p>

<p>A life-long dismissal means an admission to each
one. This passes more places and not any more faces.
This does show the joint when there is chicken. The
salad has cheese and there is no more added table. It is
so large that there is a window seat.</p>

<p>So much <ins title="persistence">persistance</ins>, so much elbow place, so much
single authority and able china, so much more and a cold
bigger, that means that there is thieves. Staining anything
is not underwear. So soon there is more motion.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_116" title="116"> </a>
Plead the use of a magazine and send more card
paper, this is so tiring and reading a letter is the same as
writing an answer. Something was handed to some one.</p>

<p>A dark tunnel has no open shelter and to be dark is
to be left lighter. This does not mean that there was a
shadow, it does not mean that a shadow has a painting
or a passage it simply means that it is unique and that
there is an explanation.</p>

<p>Keep a pint which is not fuller, keep it and throw
away everything, a little gain means that wood is not
burning, a little gain means that there is no answer, a little
gain is a little gain.</p>

<p>To see a sample of cheese means that the authority
which mingles excellence with scratching is such that a
new beginning has no swelling. All the tunes are played
and the voice is louder. There is no repair.</p>

<p>Plunder and an appetite, seasoning and sensitive singing
all this makes that come back. There is a solemn
winter. There is that.</p>

<p>To fit a car to the same stand as the pressing of
every button means that there is a decision. So much
unity does show friendship. A tangle is no less. There
are no narratives.</p>

<p>A plain pet does know how to draw. Drawing is a
sin. There is no picture. There is a comparison. All
round is the collection. There are parts anyway.</p>

<p>No part and no more, no part and never.</p>

<p>Nicely and the shape and all that section that is the
time to use a weeding. A precise desolation is so distracted.
All the curtain of river is running to be green
and yellow, all the lifting is by sitting, all the time is on
the bricks, there is no seat there, there is no church
there, there is no church, there is nowhere there. There
is no crying. There is no next butter. There is. There
is more shape to leave lower.</p>

<p>A lame stool is one that has three lengths and a
suspender, there is a collar. There is no disorder.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_117" title="117"> </a>
If the precious sand is rich and there is union then
there is something. If the precious sand is poor then
there is poverty. If there is more then there is anywhere.
What is choosing. It is the predicate when there is
illness. There is no sickness there is a package. Are the
eyes finer. They are there yesterday. They enter the
weather.</p>

<p>Lightning has no meaning, gleaning has choosing descending,
bread has origin, a taste is spreading. There
was once a made ready lifter. There was once a birthday.
There was a saleable afternoon. There was no deceiver.
There was none.</p>

<p>A little thing to send in and have a pain from singing,
a little thing and no person who is willing is signalling, no
person needs a shoe, every one says what they do, this
does not mean that hopping is swinging. It does that in
the mean time. It does that there heartily. Heartiness
is the same principle. It is no challenge. It is not more
a church. It is not most a circle. It is not a vestibule.
It is a single place of growing grass. Grass is not deserving.
It has all that to show. It shows a marked
meadow. It is not by the baker. Fishing is sudden.
There is a decision. All yesterday is passed.</p>

<p>A page of no addresses does not mean a mistake it
means that there are places where the whole family is
glad to eat together. This is not a sign of anger it is
the necessary sunshine of the country and to be pleasant
is so close that there is no change. The last time that
there was an address there was no change. If the ones
turned away they ate in a little place and ate there. If
they did not show that they were enjoying it. They did
please that most and they collected that there and it was
a hope and a silent time was not present. There was no
explanation. There was the hope of the remains being
recently for that and best taken nearer and not passed
into the same time. This did make the change stationary
and really any authority is in the language and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_118" title="118"> </a>singing is not a victim, there is no joke, the time is the
same and the place is not let, there is a little square
center and no center, there is a simple dessert, any cheese
is darker, any fish is lighter, the same thing is the place
unset, the same time is tomorrow, there is no date to
marry if marrying is replaced by having that having been
done. There is no doubt of the mention of that and there
is a taste of the meaning which is not a waste. There
was an exchange in decision. All the way is plenty if
there is the time to choose a pope, there is no choice there
then, there is no sense in a waiter. If the time has that
note then certainly the choice of a seat means that two
are not taken. The time is given and the invitation is not
pink when there is water. The little bunch is not known
and more is mentioned. All of it.</p>

<p>A dark net is not a veil and a veil is not long, it is
not longer than following repetition. Granted that there
is an hour that is half after six, granted that does that
mean that there is any use in being willing to have no
other meeting, and yet it must mean something and almost
anything is that and it is very likely, it is most likely
that there is the time and the place, it is most likely not
often, it is most likely that there is a longer day-light, it
is most likely.</p>

<p>Ham and celery and chicken, a roast is frying, the
ham if it is thickening is squeezing roast beef into a
mayonnaise dressing. There is oil, there is cake, there is
chicken. No absence is fonder.</p>

<p>All right to discuss that matter all right and the nature
is fonder when there is no choice of kissing. It is
fonder and Saturday evening is mingling borrowing some
one, not borrowing some one, that is to say there is an
offering.</p>

<p>All like a thing, all like winking, all like thinking,
all like sinking, all like that, all like a thing, all like
massaging, all like thinking, all like that, all like a vision,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_119" title="119"> </a>all like that, all like distinguishing, all like that, all like
that thing, all like that, all like thinking.</p>

<p>No old jerks, no old news, all is wet and there is
no time in a day. Every day is not away. The morning
is sooner. If the morning is sooner then the habit is
spread, it is spread and there is a whole row. Every
row has an earthquake, every ring has a color, every
piece there is is as different as it is when there is a comparison
by putting them all together. To be so particular
shows that there is a difference in copying and copying
is copying a picture, and copying is copying a piece of
sugar, and copying is copying china. All copying is so
arranged that there is no trembling when joy is filling.
All the time that sadness has is the time that sadness is.
All the temper is in place, darkness is not looking like this.
No sorrow is loaned for the succession of friendly business
intervention. A research means more. There is a
cause in extreme recognition. No place is taken. Time
for bells is ringing and breaking nothing is disturbing
urging. There is a piece.</p>

<p>A room, a paper, a fig, a chase, a poison cup, a trace
of a hat, all this together is no disappearance. The joy
prevails and the season is Sunday. The end is beyond
that.</p>

<p>If there is no question and an answer is not a toilet,
if there is no question is there any strangeness in a garden.
Certainly not, the danger is not any color. It has the
bloom and the sign of an early summer. There is no
necessity to deface anything. An escape is not needed.</p>

<p>There is one question. In not asking a question
the permission which is continued is so courteous that
there is no moon-light. The time does keep the rain
from startling more than a diary. This shows that there
is no question and an answer is no meeting.</p>

<p>The point then consists in there coming to be so
much recent relief that the advance is simultaneous and
surely if the same step is there there is no treachery.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_120" title="120"> </a>The interchange is worshipped with a boat. There is no
time in the use of money. A little means more of that
same multiplication and in any case there came that time.
There is no worry and this does not mean that there is
that absence, it does not even mean more, it does mean
that a change is enveloping. It does not mean that it
exists.</p>

<p>A tune is splendor and a turn is that which a mark
on the floor does not chasten. So much sun is not a
sunbeam. So much clarity is not stifling. Surely the
representation of an uncherished filling is not more odious
than mankind. The thought which determines a flight
is the firmness of the plant that is not boiling. All the
time which is of use is that which when the change has
the same resemblance as some origin shows no mixture
of more capping. The necessity is not ungainly and
gaining that is what is the obstacle in staging. It is no
place when the basket is there and baskets have no pink
ribbon, they have glass. A piece of the same is cheaper.</p>

<p>All the same there is an exceptional use of the point
of a resprinkler. It does not mean the same as the future.
There is that quality.</p>

<p>A pink and that is a flower and smelling, a pink and
the name is different and has some when there is intonation,
a pink and the rumor has not spread, it is ordinary.
If so and the opposition is astonishing then surely there
is that destruction and no suspicion is more, there is a
report. All the same there is more nervousness than
retraction and more in sight than outside and in any case
a name is there. Two of them are the same.</p>

<p>Was the explosion that authority, did it succeed
more than yesterday, was there tomorrow before, these
are not questions asking, they are not existing missing,
they are so applied that there is no joke, there is no
pleasure. All the same the standard is there and the
separation has a position, it has no repudiation, it has no
hurrying centralization, it has nothing there. If to be
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_121" title="121"> </a>there is mentioned then the whole response is the occasion.
It is and there is more. There is no answer. There
is turning. Turning is not a victim, it has no protection,
it has no authority, it has a receipt.</p>

<p>Time to state and to circle the whole thing to be an
island and not water, this is the season of fishing and in
and by circling there is no surface, there is all there is and
the time to rain is not the time to station swimming.
This is no disgrace.</p>

<p>All the same there is a splendid piece of special soft
sour and silk lining, there is and there is a mistake. An
object is not more used than a mixture and surely if the
time was chosen it was not there beside the swift selling
mother of colored clothing, and yet there is no sale and
there is a reason, there is the reason that anything is
the sign of a use and using nothing is not a pointed
selection, it is more than that, it is collecting.</p>

<p>This does not mean that antiquity is more antiquity,
it means that the origin of eating is eating and the renewal
of the wading is not swimming. It does not mean
that, it means that the time and place and more is so satisfied
that there is no place, and any place is no vacation.
And yet that is not so narrow and actual, not at all, if
it were and it is, if it were then certainly they would celebrate
the result, they do not that is to say one does if there
is nothing, the other does if there is nothing. There is
that establishment when there is no land and any land that
shows the line is that and is one. Any extra way is the
way of speaking. There is no use in no more.</p>

THE MANUSCRIPTS AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM</a></h2></div>


<p>The answer in the house is that talking is not the
same thing as a lamb. So that was the way it came to be
and the second answer came before the first.</p>

<p>All the part was distributed and the selection of
more was not made before the sight was so particular that
any letter had a signature. This which is even is not
the whole page, there is more that is even, very much
more and any size is larger.</p>

<p>To beam is not to seem to have an eye that is there
and a hair that is colored, to beam is not so disturbed
that any afternoon is not sooner than the next morning.
This was so useful and the excuse was not placed in
between the hotels, it was not placed anywhere. This
is the date of some days in every week, and the morning
is before noon. So simply and so strangely, so much
the more advanced, so much the more interior and so
much more coughing than learning, so very much more
and yet there is no disappointment, not any disappointment.</p>

<p>The cute way that a certain place is open on
Sunday and not on Tuesday does not mean that an invitation
will not be coming. Not at all, there is more chair
than standing exhausts.</p>

<p>So then the whole spring is earlier than February.
This was so much the tail of the previous setting of the
sun and the moon and some of the stars. Electric
lighting is so usual and more weddings are celebrated
in the place of thanksgiving.</p>

<p>A target and a round face, a beard that is not whiter,
the center of it all is that resemblance and surely there
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_135" title="135"> </a>is that to pass away and have the same decision. Surely
there is that resemblance and surely the ones standing
alone have that copy. Surely there is the safe persuasion.
Surely there is danger.</p>

<p>So to move and to faint and to separate the lists
together, so to lengthen and to shorten and to curve the
same direction, so to measure every daughter and to
lessen every sister and to manage every mother and to
sever every brother and to undertake a father and to
beam upon a lover so to sing and so to talk and so to
change the line together, all of this and any show is the
way to season nature and to have it all together means
the same in every letter.</p>

<p>This which is not so strange is the more used and
in there kindly being a face there is more resemblance
than if it were written and then comes the time to look
and there it is, there is the writing.</p>

<p>So astonishing is it not when there has been preservation.
The noise which comes has not any decisive
obligation and yet the whole date is just the same. So
sweet are the singular pleasures of recognition. The
strength of the place does not mean more than all. Some
have no distaste.</p>

<p>Link the hat and the coat and the collar, have the
hair and the eyes and the color, see the time and the tea
and altogether and do not be singular enough, and so there
is that to view and the single planter has the rest as
history. He did not tell it in giving it more room than
cloth. So early is it not.</p>

<p>Saddle the simple sore without a touch of lame
despair and do not touch the hair because there is the
use of all that pause. So sweetly is it true that neatness
does not mean the curls are true and yet there is absolutely
none, absolutely no powder. So the place is not
used for the tea and the last water is not more boiling
than is touchy.</p>

<p>Frown nowhere and do not change that space, that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_136" title="136"> </a>is the way to use the time to purchase mining pictures.
The little darkness and no large lamp, all the light being
together does not make everything strange. Please the
daylight, show the ruins that there is water, do not disturb
the lamp, make more noise than resting and more
that is changed is changed and an agreement shows the
pink not to be redder. All that partial resemblance to a
disagreement and a reunion is not more questioned than
no answer. Not any more choice is so determined, and
yet, why is the season so ingrained in the early morning
when noon is no later. There is always a return of any
answer.</p>

<p>Peace and the morning and a show of any evening,
a reflection and the pleasant state of nature, this does
make so much debt that there is no name anywhere.
So pleasing is disaster, so ancient is being old enough
in the matter.</p>

<p>Bestow a curve in the collapse and there is no withdrawal
and that which is secure has some way of preserving
any walking. All the time has a finished undertrimming
and so there has the approach to a lingering
printing.</p>

<p>To place an eye, to set the corner, to make a blessing,
and to search a mansion, to persuade the noon and to
establish harmony, the cause that is the mention is not
more pained than anything. So then there is a memory,
there is a stone home, there is no weakness.</p>

<p>Clearly and a gem, singly and all four, the stem, the
stone the happy way, the single blessing of the longing
soon, the patent habit of the leaving of the room, all this
and no white light is not more dim than every candle and
many of them make the illumination gentler, they dwindle
in large, they season the sun, they blossom the churn,
they bestow in a plant. This was no sprain, this was the
regal pin.</p>

<p>A broom and a window, both of them uttered are so
plain that there is more space and very much more hurry
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_137" title="137"> </a>and yet there is a change of address, this is written. So
clannily there will not be when the envelope is larger.
The same union is stronger. An afternoon is weaker.
That was the time and then in the evening there is dinner
and later, any time later there is more than one corner,
there is a fire, there is that, there is no pleasant place in
more fire. Then came that which pushed away a piano,
then came that and there was a whole collection. The
question was not detained. There was that to do and
arranging is done by separation. This is yellow and
brown is a color. Peace is rested when it is occupied.</p>

<p>If the three are one they do not have voices, that
means no more than that all of them are four. More is
not regulated and yet there is an introduction, there are
degrees, there is past pressing, there is the change of a
pudding. All is not any meddling of a mess and the
keen lump is not shadowed by any sun.</p>

<p>Plant the union of a question later, all the time has
that change, the pink length and the satin fixture this
does not make any question uncertain. A question if
there is no answer is a question where there is no answer.
To place more is always a way.</p>

<p>Put the partial pleasure in place and do not see more
than the town. If the town escapes and sees a building
it will be satisfied. It is.</p>

<p>When the speed is there and there is pink color there
is a pale pink, there is a color.</p>

<p>All the two baskets and the little apples and any that
are the same size in measure have so much hidden that is
not paper so very much and they think out of sight.
They do.</p>

<p>So plaintive and so careful and so many little spaces
and so largely all the time, and so pointed and so half and
the whole which is there has the other side of pinning
and the time to have the rest is not what there is to leave.
A vacation is not needed, a bundle is not needed, a precise
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_138" title="138"> </a>result of more than an example is not so different when
the division is the same.</p>

<p>Kindle the blame when the refuge is in water, express
that excitement when the paint is there to fade, see no
more and love the rest, all the tender part is running,
all the liquid taste is temperate, all the time and there is
that, all the time has only water. This is not the only
haste, there is so much of it lonely, water never has so
much that a little more is water. No kind lady has the
time, no sweet trough is lingering longer.</p>

<p>Any two who see the same time are the ones who do
not expectorate and this does not mean it is habit, it
means no more than that sometime is included when there
is no time to place pottery. Certainly there is a trifle,
any one knows what there is when there is all the table,
that does not mean that there is a collection, that does
not mean more than the place pounded. Not any single
little piece of the red makes a yellow color, and yellow
is more so than anything. So reasoning are they and
they conclude a bottle.</p>

<p>Not so sweetly as a bottle, not so sweetly anywhere.</p>

<p>To see longingly and sharply indicates a predisposition.
If there is a memory there is no use suggesting
offending.</p>

<p>Pleasant and an interval which is empty and there
is no empty way to begin again. This which makes an
appetite larger does make travelling easy.</p>

<p>All the account and most of the account is not kept
where there is more lightness than there is home. It says
more and it does mean that. It certainly does.</p>

<p>So then there is a shade of the pleasure of sensible
exclamation. There is, there is the beaming oak and the
spending of more money and then the answer, the whole
answer, does that mean that the occasion is furnished
or does it mean that no auction has any circle. What
is it like. It is like the whole reliable point which has
no measure, it is the pressed leaf and there is not anything
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_139" title="139"> </a>that shows what is obliging, nothing at all and more
organs and a little light and so much blending of an industry
all that does not lead to a margin, it does, it has
the practice and the music, it has no more bent wood than
any train that is not burning, it has not, it does make a joy.</p>

<p>Looking in the face of eyes means the strangest
elephant. Looking in the same set teeth means the
presence of a seat.</p>

<p>All the talk and all the light means the same result of
voice and a solid substance then means a tear and then
a tear. Choose the money when there is more result
and all the plainer staying for the evening. This means
that what is curious has more shortness than speech and
more hope than dangling. Surely the section is mended
and the change has not been made. Surely the name
has been mentioned.</p>

<p>He has it, he is the son and the mother, he has it,
there is no darker brother, he has it. He has it and the
length is not poisoned, he is the ample special principal
protector. He sells it cheaper.</p>

<p>He does not deny a shorter letter. He does see the
revival of unison. He does decline a match, he does
entitle that.</p>

<p>He which is the sense man in the timely story, he
and the weaker is fonder, he is the praised and the praiser,
he does not speak the waiting the weaker. He does speak
when there is a specimen rejoinder. He does play more
pastry than the tea-time. He is there for dinner. He
does not steam anyway. He has the state. He has the
craning care to endure. He is not more particular. He
is so tender. He is the link and left light.</p>

<p>The same season makes the moon strange, the same
sun light is October, the same piling of the single glass
stamp makes no monotony. There is no rejoinder. The
end is in the great division between the counting and the
bloom of passing a glass covering. If it were left and
in a way it was left, if it were left then the meaning
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_140" title="140"> </a>would be that there was hope and hope which is active
does direct that there is some one to stay there and say
it and doing so why should it determine a passage, it
should. When it should and there is more there then
certainly all of them are the same that is to say there is
a difference. Any difference is greater.</p>

than a whole sentence. And it is said and the
quotation is reasoning. It gives the whole preceding.
If there is time enough then appearances are considerable.
There are in a circle. They are tendering a circle. They
are a tender circle. They are tenderly a circle.</p>

<p>This was not past a future.</p>

<p>If the speck is plain and the tail is there tail is made
of hair. That makes that. Any one is no tailor. The
curtain is not made of wood and a candle is placed in
a candlestick and the whole, the very whole, there is no
robbery.</p>

<p>If the pet is whole and the juice is so serene then
the salt is pure and there is pepper in between. The
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_145" title="145"> </a>harness which is on the stake is used to rubbing on a
wheel. There is the complete absence of all reason for
an excuse. The time has the wealth of a separation.
The season is not that of baking.</p>

<p>Brack and <ins title="neurasthenia">neuresthenia</ins> and lean talk with a marvel
and make a spittoon clear with a mixing in a mustache.
The sense is in that.</p>

<p>Pie is not peeling and the date and the poison and
the cake when the pan is a shape is not minus all the
practice. The time is not filling.</p>

<p>Brack, Brack is the one who put up the hooks and
held the things up and ate his dinner. He is the one
who did more. He used his time and felt more much
more and came before when he came after. He did not
resemble anything more.</p>

<p>The time and place of a corner is no convenience if
it has not been filled, none at all, and if it is filled then
there is a resemblance, there is some resemblance.</p>

<p>Do not celebrate what is hearty and surely there is
no danger in expecting a strong summer. If the place
is shown to be damp there is no use in that excuse. Anyway
there is no time to rise together. They cannot sit in
a seat.</p>

<p>The time came when there was no occasion for
geography. This did not mean that there was a change
of place, it meant that there was a change of influence.
This change was understood, it was no wonder. In
understanding the whole thing of precomposition there
was no more light than sweetness, there was no more
size than bulk, there was no more load than a caravan,
there was no mingling of unison. The time did not come
any more.</p>

<p>And then the simple way was celebrated by causation
and the charge was sweetening, that is to say there was
a round mass.</p>

<p>Powder is not brown. The color does not show in
the mixture. In curving and not lengthening the disposition
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_146" title="146"> </a>there is no meeker feather. To show the wave
to be cultivated and to show the suspension of a razor
the light does shine directly. It shines and it darkens
another, it does not shine and destroy the connector, it
does not shine in a color, it does not make a brown
tender. Brown is tender, that is no trouble and no
appetite.</p>

<p>It follows that when the time is separated that the
sacrifice is not the same as when the conversation is
sensible and it is sensible to discuss carving and oak-trees
and the season and to be disturbed by a mountain and to
argue when there is no desertion. It is sensible and to be
present is enough to separate the future. If it comes to
happen that there is no eraser then certainly there is no
cause why there should be. This is the reason. The
best shape is that which is pasted without paper. At any
rate the paper is not white and brown, it is brown and
it is black and white and colored.</p>

<p>The time is not replaced by indicating the reason it
will there be resplendent travelling. This is not a question
because that is not an answer.</p>

<p>The time which was put to some place was that
is so well placed. The question is is there travelling.
There is no question as to if there is travelling where
which showed solemnity in not turning in turning. This
was so put that certainly not any more reception could
be astonishing.</p>

<p>To pass away, to choose some away, to object to
abhor that and to be not triumphant this is not the splendor
of a single standard this is the solemn reverberation
of an enlarged and of a small masterpiece.</p>

<p>The way of the man and the way of the lamp and
the way of shining and the way of settling all this is in
accord with the devastation and destruction which resembling
is not disturbing motion. This comes so soon
that talking is ennobling. This which is is what comes,
that coming is what is come and can come. Coming it
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_147" title="147"> </a>comes and is come and there is some mingling and there
is more willing than there was when the coming came to
suggest and disturb and reassure reason.</p>

<p>A lane is not a hill and a hill is a descent. To explain
this it is necessary to practice mending and disturbing
and relating. The time to go is not more arranged
than the roundness which makes for beauty and to be
round is not what there is to height.</p>

<p>The time when selection is vacation is when the perfection
is so replaced that there is a premonition. This
does make baking so easy and at the same time there is
no separation and no disgrace not even desertion. This
comes to be so told that any appearance is regal. So then
there is no announcement.</p>

<p>A little seat which is not low is not more elevated
than a little seat which is low and high. There is no
space for more than there is room for. This makes no
demand on conscience, this makes no demand on anything,
this does not alter an exhibition. The reason that
there is no alteration is that in separating spaces they
come to show that there is the same space between that
there is there where there is the place which is it in it.
This shows that there is nothing so clearly shown by the
whole exposition. It does show it, it shows the extension
of the resemblance and the unification of the differentiation
and the extension of the interval and the inhibition
of the retention of acceleration. This does show no more
than is individual. And yet there is no train that does
not go in that direction and to return is not passing that
way. Returning is not vagabonding it is a spacious interception.
The use of the spread of the arrangement
between that and that is not so wide that there are no
spaces. There are spaces. They can repose so. They
do call whiteness no wonder. They do not shudder
together. There is no example in a relation. There is
none in saving spacing.</p>

<p>A capable curtain is not used and the meaning of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_148" title="148"> </a>this is that protection on both sides is protection everywhere.
The band played longer.</p>

<p>So much sorrow in winter and so much sadness in
summer, so much nervousness in the country and so
much disturbance in the city, so much counting with a
letter and so much writing with no electrician, so much
piano color and so much musical permission, so much
steadiness in circling and so much singleness in searching,
so much bloom in labeling and so much secrecy in enlightening,
so much saving in abandoning and so much
steadying in remaining, all this and no more, so much
and not often, all this and no moment when a monument
is not mind and munificent, no time and sweetness and
no escape and separation, all this and no obliging desperation,
all this and the same moment in particular and if it
were in not passing, all and no one never to be satisfied
in signalling, no more and the choice is absent, there is a
season in the right, there is a sanction in the left, there
is a presence in the center, there is an upheaval in the
distant circumference, there is a resonance in the special
curve, there is a susceptibility in the unperspiring relation.
All this nightly and some daily and weakly and
more yearly and not certainly and not reducingly.</p>

<p>To be raised and to be so respected that there is no
doubt that the lines that are turning are the lines that
are turning, to be so respected that talking is not continuous
and the presence of nothing is more selected, to be
so raised is not an expectation, it is capable of calming.</p>

<p>There has been no doubt. There has not been any
doubt. There is not being any surface and there is not
that there then.</p>

<p>The strong hold is the mildness of the salutation of
the metropolitan. This is not obligatory and it is not
capable, neither is it casual. The mint is not where there
is no building, it is not any this is never a surprise, it is
never a surprise because when the whole thing is considered
and the whole thing when it is considered has that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_149" title="149"> </a>beginning, when it is put where there is no selection it is
then not made noticeable. To be noticeable is not declared,
in declaring it there is no speech, in not keeping
on talking there is no silence. This is not heard louder
and there is no doubt. There will not be that doubt.</p>

<p>The capacity which makes the size that has that
meaning have that meaning, that is what has the sensitiveness
which does not make anticipation, there is
reality. In that there is touching morning and in touching
morning there is no course. There is all there inclines
to be. The freedom which has no ornament is not spilled
and this does not mean anything not lively, it certainly
does not mean an extra. The practice of no pronoun is
not audacious. There is no prize in a pocket. There is
none there and the circle having a separation makes all
that which is not the same similar, it does not make it a
circle. A circle has no pleasure, it is not encircled and
there is this to say that the white and black are brown.</p>

<h2><a name="PORTRAIT_OF_PRINCE_B_D">PORTRAIT OF PRINCE B.&nbsp;D.</a></h2></div>


<p>A space is not spent, it is not used, it is similar, it
is represented. This shows no more than a latitude which
running through the center makes the surrounding. The
space is not placed, it is presented, that is the relation of
the similar settlement. To settle upon and to settle under
shows more than the similar circle it shows the degree
which makes more similarity than that, it sinks higher
and there is no roar. The section and there is a section,
the section means that penetration resembles distance, it
supplies the drop and it selects no sightless system.</p>

<p>The incident that succumbs is the one that is early.
The lateness is not tending to define a definite darkness,
it does not shine and since that time there is a large light.
The western windless is not the same as the white wind.
The white wind has no poise. There is a diamond. A
diamond is a treasure. If a treasure is that color then
there is a resemblance.</p>

<p>A trade between the one who has a hat and one who
has a hat is such that there is no hiatus. The one who
has had a hat is the one who adds that. The one who is
the one that has that is that one adding that thing. No
neglecting and adding, no single safety silent disturbing,
no neglect and no glass is there to pass away and stay.
It sees the solid sight and that which is not bright is
white, that which is single is resembling and so it comes
that when there is a show a way to pass into the recent
glow means more fire. A fine color is red and green
and purple and rose and yellow, a fine color resembles
the continuation. Any fine color is in a glass. A glass
to resist must be a glass to pass. This shows no shadow.
This shows no scratch.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_151" title="151"> </a>
A change is measured, a card is unmeasured. There
is a return of much more. Stupor is not in winning a
climate. It is lost in the remembrance of poisoning.
The list of a result in stretching a building does not make
any mark. The wheel is there. The trend is not behind
a back. It is in the window of a fenestra. The blending
is distinct interspreading. This is not the measure of
wind. The return is not so, it is occupied. The rest is
arisen.</p>

<p>There is no height. If there is there is wind. There
is wind. Height shrinks below and settlement is not
soluble. The erection of yellow is no violence. The five
are won. Single, same, purple, blue, circle. The last
which section has the reverse resemblance has no moment
and there is a tendency which in the rising of the setting
sun means new arising.</p>

<p>To shine and whine, to shatter and shrink, to collect
and settle, to stir and suck, to lose violence and select
simultaneity, to see that the whole exception is not
arrested and to satiate the lines of resemblance, this and
no more is underdone. The public and pilot, all the
shining land and the wind and no neglect, all this does
not mean that there is no denial. It has been there the
same result of no intended excavation, it has been there
and that exception planted no resemblance has a moment,
none and the illustration is planted and the time is placed.</p>

<p>So then there is no secret. A secret means that
when there is a thing there is nothing and if there is
nothing then there is no addition. A sum is not sacrificed.</p>

<p>Handing a lizard to any one is a green thing receiving
a curtain. The change is not present and the
sensible way to have agony is not precautious. Then
the shirting is extreme and there is a lilac smell and no
ginger. Halt and suggest a leaf which has no circle and
no singular center, this has that show and does judge
that there is a need of moving toward the equal height
of a hot sinking center and surface. Then there is a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_152" title="152"> </a>space, then there is exception, then there is no reason
why a pound should be smaller and all the time there
is the courage and the mint and the repeating result that
surely if there has been a change there has not been a
fire. Surely a fire is famous and a famous fire is in the
fire. Surely no more special spending shows anything.
And yet if there is no wind there is no haste and if there
is no haste why is twenty older than thirty and thirty
older than twenty-eight, why is it and why is there no
mistake. There is no mistake because there is the time
and the accusation is indented and this makes enough so
that clouding does not make a cemetery. A surprise is
not in sight. This is the sentence present. There is no
danger and the silent height is so high that sound rises
higher. This does not make sound infamous, it does not
shatter a conclusion. Nothing is hollow in water, nothing
is high in air, nothing is louder and nothing is perpendicular.
The establishment is thorough. A chance shows
a bright blue sound, a chance is the same wind out of a
window.</p>

<p>A Persian kitten is a purring kitten. The safety
that comes is so gathered that there can be news. One
oak and more oaks and the training of water this means
that a color attracts a signal it means that the result
of a certain well is seen by there being no extra example
of a kind of closet. In the beginning when there is no
rising and resisting and letting a singular section of the
whole rise together, in the beginning the imparting actual
relation to a time of surfaces does show that there is an
origin of originating. In showing this there is no repair.
There is a whole half of a turtle and the presence of
more is not rope, it is not and certainly is so wise that
fever is fainting. This is this. Then there is that and
the singular example is not predicted by resting in more
contraction. Not very and what is then to be extending
is the whole place with filling. Filling is not spreading.
The size is not that it is not proportioned to the moon
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_153" title="153"> </a>and the lantern, it is fully proportioned together and
aroused and interested. This made no measure and no
misery and no murder. There is no acute trimming nor
trembling. So then there is that thing. This is not that
silent thing. This is not the thing that is anything. This
is the thing that is that thing.</p>

<p>A large moist blue and a paler color, a large dust
rose and no water nearer, a small tall frame and no
building finer this makes a prediction that necessity is
work and then why is there no question. There is no
question because investigation is miraculous.</p>

that any one could be one not have been having if they
were to be one being one not thinking about being one
having been having family living. She was one then when
she was a young one thinking about having, about having
been having family living. She was one thinking about
this thinking, she was one feeling thinking about this
thing, she was one feeling being one who could completely
have feeling in thinking about being one who had had,
who was having family living.</p>

<p>She was one having, she was one who had had
family living. When she was a young one she was one
having, she was one having had family living.</p>

<p>She was one thinking about having family living,
about having had family living. When she was a young
one she was thinking about having family living, she was
thinking about having had family living.</p>

<p>She was feeling having had family living, she was

she was feeling having had family living, she was feeling

<p>She was knowing, when she was a young one, that
she could be completely feeling in having family living
in having had family living. She was knowing, when she
was a young one, she was knowing that she was thinking,
she was knowing that she was feeling in having family

She was feeling in being one who could be completely

<p>She was living in feeling, in thinking having had,
having family living. She had had family living. She
was having family living. She could be completely feeling
having family living, having had family living.</p>

<p>She was then a young one, she was then quite a young
one, she was later a little an older one. She was then
feeling in being one loving, she was then thinking in being
one loving. She was then living in being one loving. She
could be then one being completely loving. She was filled
then, completely filled then, she was then feeling in being
loving, she was then thinking in being loving. She was
completely filled then. She was feeling, she was thinking,
she was feeling and thinking then in being one loving.</p>

<p>She could be then one being completely loving, she

<p>If they move in the shoe there is everything to do.
They do not move in the shoe.</p>

<p>The language of education is not replacing the special
position that is the expression of the emanation of evil.
There is an expression when contemplation is not connecting
the object that is in position with the forehead
that is returning looking. It is not overpowering. That
is a cruel description. The memory is the same and surely
the one who is not older is not dead yet although if he
has been blind he is seeing. This has not any meaning.</p>

<p>Oh the bells that are the same are not stirring and
the languid grace is not out of place and the older fur
is disappearing. There is not such an end.</p>

<p>If it had happened that the little flower was larger
and the white color was deeper and the silent light was
darker and the <ins title="passage">passsage</ins> was rougher it would have been
as it was and the triumph was in the place where the light
was bright and the beauty was not losing having that
possession. That was not what was tenderly. This was
the piece of the health that was strange when there was
the disappearance that had not any origin. The darkness
was not the same. There was the writing and the preparation
that was pleasing and succeeding and being enterprising.
It was not subdued when there was discussion,
it was done where there was the room that was not a
dream.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_160" title="160"> </a>
This is all to prepare the way that is not the way to
like anything that in speaking is telling what has come
that like a swelling is inside when there is yellowing.</p>

<p>There is that liking. That does not shape the way to
say that there is not anywhere anything that is resembling.
Perfection is not adulteration. There is the substance
that has not any defect.</p>

<p>If the program is not despondent and it has that
substance then certainly the beginning is the tender blessing
that unfolding is not subduing. There is that presentment
and the quiet is not so sound but that there can
be a change of origin. There can be that elevation. This
is not an argument. There is the work that has that place
and there is a garden. A little taller bending does not
haste the erection of the grotto that has a fountain.
That is so soon.</p>

<p>To pardon, that is to have seen that there was a long
way to stare when the heat was the same as there was
when the voices were together. This was the temptation
and so solidly was there when there was there that the
whole reception was not filled with more than all every
day who had come anywhere and had heard that there
was. This did not mean more than all. It meant all and
the result of the precious and precise way was that there
was that preparation and not the disintegration when
there was that distinct evolution. There could be the
same if any one was certain that there is not any evolution.
This does not make the tedium that is eternal so
particular that listening is a blessing. This does not
disguise a flower.</p>

<p>Come in and that expression is not that one of
waiting. To use a name is not the time that seeing has
not been. This is discussion. This is obligation. This
is the composition.</p>

<p>Oh sadly has the oak-tree not that sadness. It has
not the particular reason. It has not that digression. It
has not that penetration. It has that piece that is there
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_161" title="161"> </a>where there is all that remains when everything remains.
Nothing is all old. That is not the redoubtable repudiation.
That has that precious meaning when the hindrance
has not that little pain which is not the same as the passing
out of what is not about when it is there where there is
no care to say that anything is better. Everything has
that description. That is not reorganization. The way
to say that they went away is the way that the passage
has come to be adhered. This is not the token that shows
the steering that is not broken. The plea is not that the
arabesque has that meaning when the whole thing is exposed.
The meaning is that the precious picture is the
bargain that has not met the ancient day when there is
everything to say. The light is finer. That is not that
discrimination. That is the way to have that to keep
where there is not any interdiction. She had that name.
That was the origin of the penguin. That was not that
bird. And because the strong man is the warder when
the little ones are sounder so the particular ticket is not
limited when there is not the best establishment where
all the black and white show that. It is a blessing when
there has been falling the heavy way to stay where the
regard is what is not all that distance. The breaking of
the tame show is not the way to glow because the waste
is not there. It is not any where.</p>

<p>Mark the data that tells the merit of having that
time to state that not to wait is to say that the door has
not been entered. If to wait marks the place where the
entrance if it is made comes to be approached then to do
what is not done is to do all that and carefully that which
is solid does not fill the space. That is not a disclosure.
That is not the way for all of them who are
looking to refuse to see. That is not at all any such way.
It is not a pleasure to be the one when there is the whole
of it all and when there where there is no separation there
is weeping, quite ostentation, completion, not any compensation,
where there is the softening of the published
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_162" title="162"> </a>soap. This is not that decree. There is no failure.
There is no condition of incision.</p>

<p>Particle of all the color is that which is not white and
the black which is open is not older when the time has
come back for black to be younger.</p>

<p>The meaning of this is that why the difference is
always louder is that that which is above that which is
all there is and there is much is that there is all that there
has that reason to be which is the reason that is all certain
and this which is not mentioned and which does not make
that which is lost is the same and has the detail which
does not make any escaping remain separate. This does
adjoin all and all is enough so that the whole which is
not parted has not the place where sticking makes anything
that is wet dry. This has not that mistake when
softness is union.</p>

<p>The first time.</p>

<p>Winning distinction is discretion and all who are
going are the three who have not that distraction. They
have not all the hardihood. They are not separated. The
two who are not older are not remaining to be interesting.
They are not undertaking any beginning. Excellent is
the same union. Breathless is not the shade when the
opening is not limiting. They did not seem in that place.
That was any end.</p>

<p>She.</p>

<p>If three are eager and plainer and having a full
temper and if all of them unite in that happy way that
makes a garden give the way to be there where there
is a way, if there is the last time and a young time is
a stolen beauty then the way it has been said that the
white flower has not been bled is the way to remember
that decision is not the same as crumpling a parting.
She did not animate what was mechanical. She has not
this to do.</p>

<p>They.</p>

<p>They were the three and they were not employed in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_163" title="163"> </a>looking. They had not every union when they had that
education.</p>

<p>To be they and then not be away is not the time and
place that makes the whole expression because after all
when there is the time and the place and when they are
they they are not away and that does not make any more.
If they were there they had the time to see which way
was older and when they did not feel that stain they had
the time to address what they did address when they
would address one another. They did not all listen.</p>

<p>No silence.</p>

<p>There was not that hesitation and this was not all
there was when the sounds were not so loud but that
they might be hearing. They had the quiet and surely
if they taught that they were each one not all of any other.
This was not the half of all the time. It took a separate
ticket.</p>

<p>All the time that there was all the winning of all the
wonder that was not under the weather was not passing
as the exchange was not lessening. The older was not
newer. They had the same description. This does not
mean that if there are all three to learn that not any one
is there but they have any way to say that not to go away
is to stay. They were equal to enough so that all the
separation made them remain. They had so much excess.</p>

<p>It was not the only smile the smile that did not come
to face the pleasure of there being three and the three
were not there to gather together.</p>

<p>One.</p>

<p>If the way to learn is to have that presence then
certainly the changes did not balance the description.
She had that which was not alarming.</p>

<p>Two.</p>

<p>If the habit of saying all the education is the development
of that expression then certainly if there is being
pleasant all can be there to not expect that measure of
all who are together.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_164" title="164"> </a>
Three.</p>

<p>The one who is a sun is the last flower that is not
open when all the petals falling feel the whole of all
intention.</p>

<p>So there are then what is not what will not have
been when all the seeing that is and is not seen is had
and has been having having and having had and meaning.
That is some intention and all is enough to complete all
the whole.</p>

<p>The delay was not that which separated that separation
from the time when all the ones who said something
said every thing. It was not so in place.</p>

<p>The change.</p>

<p>There was not any time and all there was was reason.
There was all that and if there were all there were there
were the ones there were.</p>

<p>That which was pleasing was not all there was if
there was all there was of that consideration. Certainly
the time was not the present and past flavor and the time
was not the future and the present presentation. There
was all there and sincerely did the biting that was not bit
fill out the strength and explanation. It did not furnish
the intention. It did not succeed when there was all that
care.</p>

<p>This which did not escape was not the narrow connection
that can make a larger blossom and make it take
the sea where the ocean is larger and the ships are
quicker. The pleasure is the same.</p>

<p>To face that way.</p>

<p>To face the way that each one does say that they have
any day which is clearly not away is to say that the time
is not there when the color is not lighter and the hair is
not redder. This does not make all there is of any invitation.
There is not anything of any such suggestion.</p>

<p>If the practice of the present and the practice of the
past and there is any practice and the practice of the
future then latterly there is not any change. If the way
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_165" title="165"> </a>to say the turn is the turn the way that is the way to turn
that way then all of the thing is in that thing. There has
been all of that painstaking.</p>

<p>Awhile while there is no band, awhile while the train
is late, awhile while the town is full, awhile while the
sounds have the tone, awhile there is a settled waste and
this is not to say that anything that is given away is given
away, nothing is wasted that is not given away and anything
that is given away is wasted. The appearance is
not the only way to say that what is given away is wasted
and nothing is given away. It is so remained.</p>

<p>That which is not tiring and that which is not aiding
any of that which is not needing tiring, that was the
sampler and there was not the sewing which was using
any corner. That did not need the same width as all that
is solid is using which is not wider. That which is solid
is all that is wider and the rest is not that which has that
passing odor which is not passing. It does not pass
anything. It is not the only primrose. It has the sentence
that in placing what is not that care has all that is which
is all there where any more care is most care. There
where the time is not cruel is the place where the time
is what is filling the half and the whole and no passage
that has that intention can be intended when that which
is solid is not building every house. All houses are open
that is to say a door and a window and a table and the
waiter make the shadow smaller and the shadow which
is larger is not flickering.</p>

<h2><a name="A_PORTRAIT_OF_F_B">A PORTRAIT OF F.&nbsp;B.</a></h2></div>


<p>A peal is that mountain which makes a ring and is
ringing. There is no squeak, there is no touch there is
no lump, a light bed is left when it is carried away, it
has no temper, it has when it has, it has the bent bedspread,
it lies like that left not limply and next to lightly
and no mixed more. It is so christened when it is there.
It has that space to identify. It is the mending of the
beam and it is not clear and shows the courage more of
the plentiful timber which is not scattered and put together.
It is so lightly clad and furs show it. It is so
planter. There is no occasion and the copy is not reversed
to so little, there is nothing tiny.</p>

<p>Leave the package will the book use the warmer
there, sight the sound that has no platter, season all the
simple ginger, make a bucket simpler.</p>

<p>Praise the lion and the rat, see the morsels fairly,
show the swimming of the rat show the rabbit winning.
Bestow the light and chase it there, see the hall is dimmer,
see the lightening everywhere see the lightening dimmer.
Make no dinner in the morning, make it in the evening,
see the same and see it there, see it in the morning. See
the time when there is that, see it in the morning, see it
all and say the hat, say it every morning, say no more
and undertake what is so ridiculous that there is no time
to say that and any how what is the abuse of an intention,
why should there be etiquette, why is there every
lightening, why if the season is the same is there summer,
when is there more night than in winter.</p>

<p>Return after the garden, remain after the tea, single
out a timepiece, so hatly and so true there is neither
more to do. All the time is the past and piece meal is
that meal and a little chicken is a liver, and solitude is
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_177" title="177"> </a>enough. A little jerk is no occasion, so supremely is
there a category.</p>

<p>Very good the place is rough, the bed is silver and
the sheets are there, the little slipper is not organized, the
pleasure is obtained and actually there is a garden. In
union there is withering. In sunlight there is breakfast.</p>

<p>A turn of the table does not mean that cups are there,
it means that there is no loneliness and it means that the
copy is not extreme when there is a frame. It does not
mean any little thing.</p>

<p>A clatter registered has a calming center. That is
the outlasting of a sight of all. If it is possible that there is
the result then certainly no one would think so. Every one
does. There is no sense in such a history. There is no sense
at all. Not a bit of broom has the window open, not a bit.</p>

<p>No borrowing or lending and pearls are sweet. They
are the same as a little chain, they have the color early,
they see the time and they need no wine and they secure
the distaste of pink pepper.</p>

<p>Choose running anyway, that is to say that rolling
has more distinction, choose a feather boa and range all
the plumes and a yellow one is sweeter.</p>

<p>Bake a table, the rest is empty, see the plate first,
the first is distributed, see the arrangement the arrangement
is in the curling Christmas.</p>

<p>Bet more than sugar, copy no more principally, restrict
more decoration, repeat the needle. There is made.</p>

<p>So to see and so to go and so to turn the list around,
so to go and so there is the practice of Nileing. Plainer
sheets have simple stripes.</p>

<p>A target is by way of marks. The youngest is
shaken. The pleasure is rested.</p>

<p>The length is the laughing dater, there is no challenge
in mingling later. There is none, the rate is facing a lender.</p>

<p>All along and in the mind there is a plate and there
is meal. There is the rate that makes no more. The
stairs are not stumbling.</p>

THE WEDDING</p>

<p>It is not for nothing that the row placed quantity

a can, a single hole, a wild suggesting wood, a half carpet
and a pillow, a pillow increasing, a shirt in a cloud, a dirty
distress, a thing grey, a thing thin, a long shout, a wonder,
an over piece of cool oil, a sugar can, a shut open accident,
a result in a feat, a copper, any copper. A cape coat, in

joke. Any nice way to remain is longer than was necessary
and the temptation the real temptation never happens,
there is a cut away and there is a kind of a mellow cheese

<h2><a name="WHAT_HAPPENED">WHAT HAPPENED<br/>
<small>A FIVE ACT PLAY</small></a></h2></div>


<p class="small-capped-heading">ACT&nbsp;ONE</p>

<p>(One.)</p>

<p>Loud and no cataract. Not any nuisance is
depressing.</p>

<p>(Five.)</p>

<p>A single sum four and five together and one, not
any <ins title="sum">sun</ins> a clear signal and an exchange.</p>

<p>Silence is in blessing and chasing and coincidences
being ripe. A simple melancholy clearly precious and on
the surface and surrounded and mixed strangely. A
vegetable window and clearly most clearly an exchange
in parts and complete.</p>

<p>A tiger a rapt and surrounded overcoat securely
arranged with spots old enough to be thought useful and
witty quite witty in a secret and in a blinding flurry.</p>

<p>Length what is length when silence is so windowful.
What is the use of a sore if there is no joint and no
toady and no tag and not even an eraser. What is the
commonest exchange between more laughing and most.
Carelessness is carelessness and a cake well a cake is a
powder, it is very likely to be powder, it is very likely to
be much worse.</p>

<p>A shutter and only shutter and Christmas, quite
Christmas, an only shutter and a target a whole color in
every center and shooting real shooting and what can
hear, that can hear that which makes such an establishment
provided with what is provisionary.</p>

<p>(Two.)</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_206" title="206"> </a>
Urgent action is not in graciousness it is not in clocks
it is not in water wheels. It is the same so essentially, it
is a worry a real worry.</p>

<p>A silence a whole waste of a desert spoon, a whole
waste of any little shaving, a whole waste altogether open.</p>

<p>(Two.)</p>

<p>Paralysis why is paralysis a syllable why is it not
more lively.</p>

<p>A special sense a very special sense is ludicrous.</p>

<p>(Three.)</p>

<p>Suggesting a sage brush with a turkey and also
something abominable is not the only pain there is in so
much provoking. There is even more. To begin a lecture
is a strange way of taking dirty apple blossoms and
is there more use in water, certainly there is if there is
going to be fishing, enough water would make desert and
even prunes, it would make nothing throw any shade
because after all is there not more practical humor in a
series of photographs and also in a treacherous <ins title="sculpture">scupture</ins>.</p>

<p>Any hurry any little hurry has so much subsistence,
it has and choosing, it has.</p>


<p class="small-capped-heading">ACT&nbsp;TWO</p>

<p>(Three.)</p>

<p>Four and nobody wounded, five and nobody flourishing,
six and nobody talkative, eight and nobody sensible.</p>

<p>One and a left hand lift that is so heavy that there
is no way of pronouncing perfectly.</p>

<p>A point of accuracy, a point of a strange stove, a
point that is so sober that the reason left is all the chance
of swelling.</p>

<p>(The same three.)</p>

<p>A wide oak a wide enough oak, a very wide cake,
a lightning cooky, a single wide open and exchanged box
filled with the same little sac that shines.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_207" title="207"> </a>
The best the only better and more left footed
stranger.</p>

<p>The very kindness there is in all lemons oranges
apples pears and potatoes.</p>

<p>(The same three.)</p>

<p>A same frame a sadder portal, a singular gate and
a bracketed mischance.</p>

<p>A rich market where there is no memory of more
moon than there is everywhere and yet where strangely
there is apparel and a whole set.</p>

<p>A connection, a clam cup connection, a survey, a
ticket and a return to laying over.</p>


<p class="small-capped-heading">ACT&nbsp;THREE</p>

<p>(Two.)</p>

<p>A cut, a cut is not a slice, what is the occasion for
representing a cut and a slice. What is the occasion for
all that.</p>

<p>A cut is a slice, a cut is the same slice. The reason
that a cut is a slice is that if there is no hurry any time is
just as useful.</p>

<p>(Four.)</p>

<p>A cut and a slice is there any question when a cut
and a slice are just the same.</p>

<p>A cut and a slice has no particular exchange it has
such a strange exception to all that which is different.</p>

<p>A cut and only slice, only a cut and only a slice, the
remains of a taste may remain and tasting is accurate.</p>

<p>A cut and an occasion, a slice and a substitute a
single hurry and a circumstance that shows that, all this
is so reasonable when every thing is clear.</p>

<p>(One.)</p>

<p>All alone with the best reception, all alone with more
than the best reception, all alone with a paragraph and
something that is worth something, worth almost anything,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_208" title="208"> </a>worth the best example there is of a little occasional
archbishop. This which is so clean is precious little when
there is no bath water. A long time a very long time
there is no use in an obstacle that is original and has a
source.</p>


<p class="small-capped-heading">ACT&nbsp;FOUR</p>

<p>(Four and four more.)</p>

<p>A birthday, what is a birthday, a birthday is a speech,
it is a second time when there is tobacco, it is only one
time when there is poison. It is more than one time when
the occasion which shows an occasional sharp separation
is unanimous.</p>

<p>A blanket, what is a blanket, a blanket is so speedy
that heat much heat is hotter and cooler, very much
cooler almost more nearly cooler than at any other time
often.</p>

<p>A blame what is a blame, a blame is what arises and
cautions each one to be calm and an ocean and a masterpiece.</p>

<p>A clever saucer, what is a clever saucer, a clever
saucer is very likely practiced and even has toes, it has
tiny things to shake and really if it were not for a delicate
blue color would there be any reason for every one
to differ.</p>

<p>The objection and the perfect central table, the
sorrow in borrowing and the hurry in a nervous feeling,
the question is it really a plague, is it really an oleander,
is it really saffron in color, the surmountable appetite
which shows inclination to be warmer, the safety in a
match and the safety in a little piece of splinter, the real
reason why cocoa is cheaper, the same use for bread as for
any breathing that is softer, the lecture and the surrounding
large white soft unequal and spread out sale of more
and still less is no better, all this makes one regard in a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_209" title="209"> </a>season, one hat in a curtain that in rising higher, one
landing and many many more, and many more many
more many many more.</p>


<p class="small-capped-heading">ACT&nbsp;FIVE</p>

<p>(Two.)</p>

<p>A regret a single regret makes a door way. What
is a door way, a door way is a photograph.</p>

<p>What is a photograph a photograph is a sight and
a sight is always a sight of something. Very likely there
is a photograph that gives color if there is then there
is that color that does not change any more than it did
when there was much more use for photography.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><i>All together.</i></p>

<p>Cunning very cunning and cheap, at that rate a sale
is a place to use type writing. Shall we go home.</p>

<p>Cunning, cunning, quite cunning, a block a strange
block is filled with choking.</p>

<p>Not too cunning, not cunning enough for wit and
a stroke and careless laughter, not cunning enough.</p>

<p>A pet, a winter pet and a summer pet and any kind
of a pet, a whole waste of pets and no more hardly more
than ever.</p>

<p>A touching spoon a real touching spoon is golden
and show in that color. A really touching spoon is
splendid, is splendid, and dark and is so nearly just right
that there is no excuse.</p>

<p>The best way is to wave an arm, the best way is to
show more used to it than could be expected.</p>

<p>Comfort a sudden way to go home, comfort that and
the best way is known.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><i>All together.</i></p>

<p>Hold hard in a decision about eyes. Hold the tongue
in a sober value as to bunches. See the indication in all
kinds of rigorous landscapes. Spell out what is to be
expected.</p>

<p>Show much blame in order and all in there, show
much blame when there is a breath in a flannel. Show
the tongue strongly in eating. Puzzle anybody.</p>

<p>Violet and the ink and the old ulster, shut in trembling
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_211" title="211"> </a>and a whole departure, flood the sunshine, terrorize
the grown didy, mingle sweetness with communion.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><i>All together.</i></p>

<p>Change the sucking with a little sucking.</p>

<p>Modify the brave gallant pin wheel. Show the shout,
worry with wounds, love out what is a pendant and a
choke and a dress in together.</p>

<p>Punish the grasshopper with needles and pins are
plenty. Show the old chink.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><i>All together.</i></p>

<p>Put the putty in before the door put the oil glass in
with what is green. Put the mellow choice with all the
test, rust with night and language in the waist. Praise
the cat and show the twine the door, mention every scrap
of linen carpet, see the eagle and behold the
west, win the day light with the hat unpressed, show it in
a shudder and a limp, make a best container with no
speed, and a jacket and a choice and beets, beets are what
there are when bets are less. Bets are less in summer.</p>


<p class="center heading-space">Single Witnesses</p>

<p>(I). A spread out case is so personal it is a
mountain of change and any little piece is personal, any
one of them is an exchange. No forethought is removed.
Nothing, hindrances, butter, a safe smooth, a safe why is
a tongue a season, why is a loin large by way of spoiling.
There is no cake in front. A choking is an example.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><i>More witnesses.</i></p>

<p>It is true, it certainly is true and a coat any coat,
any dress, all dress, a hat, many hats, all colors, every
kind of coloring, all this makes shadows longer and birds,
makes birds, just makes birds.</p>

<p>Not much limping is in the back, not much limping
is in the front, not much limping is circular, a bosom, a
candle, an elegant foot fall, all this makes daylight.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_212" title="212"> </a>
<i>Single Witnesses.</i></p>

<p>(2). A blunder in a charger is blue. A high pocket
not higher than the wrist and the elbow, the pocket is not
added.</p>

<p>A clutch, a real clutch is merry and a joke and a
baby, a real clutch is such a happy way. A real clutch
is so soon worried so easily made the same, so soon
made so.</p>

<p>A real white and blue, blue and blue, blue is raised
by being so and more much more is ready. At last a
person is safe.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><i>More witnesses.</i></p>

<p>Pile in the windows, freeze with the doors, paint with
the ceiling, shut in the floors, paint with the ceiling, paint
with the doors, shut in the ceiling, shut out the doors,
shut in the doors, shut in the floors, shut in the floors,
shut in the doors.</p>

<p>Put the patient goat away, put the patient boat away,
put away the boat and put it, the boat, put it, put away
that boat. Put away the boat.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><i>Single Witnesses.</i></p>

<p>(3). An army of invincible and ever ready mustaches
and all the same mind and a way of winding and
no more repertoire, not any more noise, this did increase
every day.</p>

<p>A moon, a moon, a darkness and the stars and little
bits of eels and a special sauce, not a very special sauce,
not only that.</p>

<p>A wide pair that are not slippers, not a wide pair
of slippers, not pressed to be any of that in that particular
but surely, surely, surely a loan, surely every kind of a
capital.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><i>More Witnesses.</i></p>

<p>A splendid little charles louis philip, a splendid spout
of little cups and colds, a splendid big stir, a splendid
glass, a splendid little splinter, a splendid cluster.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_213" title="213"> </a>
<i>Single Witnesses.</i></p>

<p>(4). Why should wet be that and cut, cut with
the grass, why should wet be that and clut with the purse,
why should wet be wet and the wet that wet. Why
should wet be the time to class. Why should there be
solemn cuppings.</p>

<p>The lean bark, that is the round and intense and
common stop and in shouting, the left bark and the right
bark and a belt, in that belt, in no belt and a corset, in
a belt and chores, in a belt and single stitches, in more
boys than enough, in all thin beer and in all such eggs, in
all the pile and in all the bread, in the bread, in the bread,
in the condition of pretty nearly saying that yesterday is
today, and tomorrow, tomorrow is yesterday. The
whole swindle is in short cake and choice cake is white
cake and white cake is sponge cake and sponge cake is
butter.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><i>House to house.</i></p>

<p>(1). A habit that is not left by always screaming,
a habit that is similar to the one that made quiet quite
quiet and made the whole plain show dust and white
birds and little plaintive drops of water, a habit which
brightened the returning butter fly and the yellow weed
and even tumbling, the habit which made a well choose
the bottom and refuses all chances to change, the habit
that cut in two whatever was for the use of the same
number, the habit which credited a long touch with raising
the table and the hour glass and even eye glasses and
plenty of milk, the habit which made a little piece of
cheese wholesome and darkness bitter and clanging a
simple way to be solemn, a habit which has the best
situation and nearly all the day break and the darkness
a habit that is cautious and serious and strange and
violent and even a little disturbed, a habit which is better
than almost anything, a habit that is so little irritating,
so wondering and so unlikely is not more difficult than
every other.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_214" title="214"> </a>
(2). A change a real change is made by a piece,
by any piece by a whole mixture of words and likenesses
and whole outlines and ranges, a change is a butt and
a wagon and an institution, a change is a sweetness and a
leaning and a bundle, a change is no touch and buzzing
and cruelty, a change is no darkness and swinging and
highness, a change is no season and winter and leaving,
a change is no stage and blister and column, a change
is no black and silver and copper, a change is no jelly
and anything proper, a change is not place, a change is
not church, a change is not more clad, a change is not
more in between when there is that and the change is
the kind and the king is the king and the king is the king
and the king is the king.</p>

<p>(3). Could there be the best almost could there be
almost the most, could there be almost almost, could there
be the most almost. Could there be the most almost, could
there be the most almost, could there be almost almost.
Could there be almost, almost.</p>

<p>Can the stretch have any choice, can the choice have
every chunk, can the choice have all the choice, can the
stretch have in the choice. Can there be water, can
there be water and water. Can there be water. Can
there be.</p>

<p>(4). A cousin to cooning, a cousin to that and
mixed labor and a strange orange and a height and a piece
of holy phone and a catching hat glass and a bit of undertaking.
All this makes willows and even then there is
no use in dusting not in really redusting, not in really
taking everything away. The best excuse for shadows
is in the time when white is starched and hair is released
and all the old clothes are in the best bag.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><i>House to house.</i></p>

<p>A wet hurt and a yellow stain and a high wind and
a color stone, a place in and the whole real set all this and
each one has a chin. This is not a claim it is a reorganization
and a balance and a return.</p>

painted white and is enormously disappointing. Some one
has been willing. Oh I am disgusted. This is not the

<p class="no-indent">(Helen.) The same. I am a settled character. I have
visions of welcoming them. They do behave so well and
eat so regularly and very well too. They grow almonds
in their grounds and I like to eat them green or later.
I like to eat them. They are willing. Do not disappoint

<p>Jenny is sick.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Jenny.) I am sick.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(The lawyer.) I went often to see you and every day
I said I love you better I do love you better. That's it.</p>

<p>They were together and they said John are you

<p>Mamma coockcoo.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Pirate.) What is a pirate not a man who kills and

<p class="center">The Scene</p>

<p>Conversation. I asked him did he like to hear the
dog bark. He said he would shoot at him. I said did he
like to hear it. We were ashamed of his servants. They
talked together loudly. We hoped he would control them.
He wrote it. So did they together. Please have peace.
Say the date. Please have the Fangturm. Please have
peace. Please don't fish so near the shore. Please do
not be asked to buy it when it is living. It is not disgusting.
All of us are not so pleased.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Nicholas and Jane.)</p>

<p class="no-indent">They are old. They have taken the house for the
month of September and we do hope that they will go
away. We do hope that they will go away.</p>

The proprietor came and took the almonds. We said
do not take the grapes, we will not give you the key.</p>

<p>Have we gotten as far as that.</p>

<p>Mallorcan singing.</p>

<p>They are all singing they sing the song about the
chicken. Jenny Chicken does not sing a song about the
chicken. She says she does not like them small.</p>

<p>I am so bothered.</p>

<p>I am angry.</p>

<p>I am angry at these sounds. They say.</p>

<p>This is Spain and I say. It is not.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Nicholas.) I have a governess. She tells me to pray.
I am not religious.</p>

<p>Servants can speak to each other. Two of them
have long hair. They all wear it down their back.</p>

<p>Come in. We are not coming tonight. We hope to
see the fire-works. There will also be a procession. Do
you believe you will see the procession. We will see the
fire-works from here.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Paul.) Thunder. It will not rain yet. It usually does
not at this season. I hope that a war will come. I would
like to be interpreter.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Antonio.) I believe in merrymaking. It has been
possible for me to catch fish. I avoided cooking the lunch
by leaving two young boys in charge. Their names were
Clarence and Emanuel.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Clarence.) I will see to everything.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Emanuel.) I will help you.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Pablo.) I will be of some assistance.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Antonio.) I will come when called.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Maggie.) I do not like hot weather.</p>

<p>The part of the house which has windows back and
front is cooler.</p>

<p>Coming together.</p>

<p>We move.</p>

<p>I will tell you about Eugenia. She moved the table
and hopes to be married. I do not think so because I do
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_219" title="219"> </a>not think she is attractive. There is not a family in which
some do not embroider. It is a great industry.</p>

<p>The wind.</p>

<p>There is wind every day.</p>

<p>I am so disappointed.</p>

<p>It is difficult to stop now because of annoyances.
Now we will tell of the things that were sent together.</p>

<p>We were surprised they had not moved in. Open
homes.</p>

<p>Go on. Go on.</p>

<p>Making people better.</p>

<p>The servants. They did say that they were Spanish.
I said they weren't. I said Spaniards were polite.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Nicholas.) I have seen the consul he is going to get
me my passport.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(William.) But he can't he is only consular agent. He
has to send to Barcelona.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Nicholas.) I was not speaking of him. I was speaking
of the ambassador.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(William.) Oh that's another matter.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Clement came in they said that they
had lost a friend.</p>

<hr/>

<p class="center">Music.</p>

<p>When they ask for money for the sailors who were
drowned they make gay music.</p>

<p>When they say here is some one who refuses to give
them something they are impertinent.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Brothers.) How did we know they were brothers. We
knew it because they have the same perplexity. He has
lost money in boats and he has in steel cars.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Officials.) Come together you can fly a kite if you like.
We do not like. We like to see others do it. It is not
much trouble. It depends entirely on the height of the
house.</p>

Nicholas Jane and Anthony and the evening rain.
It comes every morning about two and we have the habit

any one think that they embroidered the name in
Mallorca.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Stephen.) How much is it.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Stephen.) Forty-five.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Stephen.) We will change it to forty.</p>

<p>Older ones have gotten to see that it's dangerous
to go to Marseilles.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(The colonel.) He owns this house and he wants the
almond crop.</p>

<p>We said we did not know that.</p>

<p>He said it was in the lease. Mr. Clement said he had
never heard of such a thing being done.</p>

<p>We met an old frenchman.</p>

<p>We met the people who are going around together
and asking for money.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Genevieve.) Widows should have it.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Bobbie.) Do as you like.</p>

<p>We asked them not to come in.</p>

<p>The dealer his wife and the servant. Hush don't
wake anybody. You must not call out to one another.
Everybody does it. We do not ask you to control the
others. We have decided not to say anything to you
about them.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(The owner of the house.) I am assisting and I am
further obliged to come tomorrow. Will you kindly give
me the key.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(The servant.) Will you kindly give me some water.
Will you show me the way to go.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(The wife.) I will not believe that they are settled.
It is a great disappointment to me.</p>

<p>Plenty of time.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_221" title="221"> </a>
Beginning tomorrow can we count a month before
they return to the city.</p>

<p>Counting tomorrow can we count a month before
they leave the country.</p>

<p>It is a disappointment to me that we have not been
able to be rid of that which is bothering us. It is a
great disappointment to me.</p>

<p>Two count, we count two.</p>

<p>The one came first.</p>

<p>He eats sweetbreads by preference and he has a
wife and a child. I did not mean him.</p>

<p>The one came later and is really not very well
pleased.</p>

<p>He does not care for the vegetables which are for
sale here.</p>

<p>We know an old man that we like better. We like
to see that he is met.</p>

<p>When did the owner of the house decide to write
to us. He did not write. He came.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(The owner.) It was agreed that you take it by three
months. It will disturb me to come up once a month for
the money.</p>

<p>It was agreed that we take it by the month and we
will send you your money by mail.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(The owner.) If it is lost it will be at your risk.</p>

<p>It will not be lost.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(The owner.) I am very anxious to have you pleased
with the house.</p>

<p>We like the view.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(The owner.) Did the storm do much injury.</p>

<p>A little rain came in.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(The owner.) I meant to the trees.</p>

<p>I do not think so.</p>

<p>What is it.</p>

<p>We went together.</p>

<p>We did not feel too warm.</p>

<p>There is much talk of obligation.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_222" title="222"> </a>
We never have butter.</p>

<p>We are not going to.</p>

<p>The rest of the day was there. He said that he
would be pleased if we came again and asked for that
which we were to get.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(The older woman.) Do not for one moment think of
not receiving back that which is owing to you.</p>

<p>We said that we have made a mistake.</p>

<p>Excuse me. Come in some time tomorrow.</p>

<p>Tomorrow in a week.</p>

<p>A week is over on Sunday.</p>

<p>Come tomorrow.</p>

<p>This evening at four.</p>

<p>Tomorrow too.</p>

<p>Come tomorrow or early not before six.</p>

<p>We will have them to-morrow.</p>

<p>Yes tomorrow.</p>

<p>They had them. They were the kind that lit themselves.
We were so careful. We said yes we like the
kind that we have had.</p>

<p>By believing in everything we happen to be careful
to ask what was paid.</p>

<p>It is necessary to know how the time is arranged.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(William.) Teeth, do not mention teeth. My front
teeth are longer.</p>

<p>Is it surprising that every one is fond of mutton.</p>

<p>Is it.</p>

<p>I think it is.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Monica.) I am careful about turns. I walk up hill.</p>

<p>She is enthusiastic she has gone in whenever there
was kite flying.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Anthony.) Whatever you do don't make a noise.</p>

<p>Please be careful of me.</p>

<p>Let us talk about fowls.</p>

<p>When we went hunting we had eleven dogs. They
ran after rabbits. We went there. Ours is certainly

<p>He did not call me away.</p>

<p>He was hoping for other results. We bowed politely.</p>

<p>To be seventy five together.</p>

<p>To be able to see stitches.</p>

<p>To have decided not to stay here.</p>

<p>We will not see to count.</p>

<p class="center">The End of May</p>

<p>The weather in June is like the weather in September.
The end of May is cooler.</p>

<p>The bathman is disgusted that the Mallorcans don't
bathe in September. The water is warm in September.
It is warmer in July and August.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(The War.) Are there German submarines in Spanish
waters.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Signor Dato.) There are no german submarines in
Spanish waters.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Marquis of Ibyza.) I have.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(The King.) Then leave them all alone.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(The Cuban Boat.) It has sunk.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(The sailors.) They all came from Saint Katherine
square.</p>

<p>The sailors were all drowned. A great deal of
money was collected for their families.</p>

<p>In speaking of Mallorca we must remember that
there is making acquaintance. They make acquaintance
with each other.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Jane.) I will not be old. I have four children. The
two servants are man and wife.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Iphegenia.) To work hard is commendable if one earns
money. I do not wish to be married. I wish to be sure
of marriage. I have selected my sisters. They do embroidery.
I will not copy them. I am not so old. I have
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_224" title="224"> </a>a younger brother and sister. I do not pay attention.
We do not pay attention to one another. I am in a way
disappointed. I do believe in fish. Everybody does in
Mallorca.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Paul.) I am going to see John.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(John.) Come when you like. How is your wife.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Paul.) My wife is tired. We walked too far yesterday.
It was beautiful moonlight.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(John.) Remember me to her.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Paul.) How is your wife today.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(John.) Oh she is all right now.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Paul.) And Bartholomew.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(John.) Bartholomew is not here just now. He has
gone down stairs.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Paul.) Yes I saw Bartholomew when I came in.</p>

<p>We do not know whether it has anything to do with
the weather whether they will go away. It is said by
every one that almost every one goes away by the middle
of October. They came in July. We hear something.</p>

<p>Yes it's german. They give French music too and
one English and one American. They are all there but
they do not say it.</p>

<p>I dance.</p>

<p>Keep still.</p>

<p>Do keep still.</p>

<p>They keep our dog still.</p>

<p>We kept our dog still.</p>

<p>We can see signs that they are going away. I do not
wish to say this in the manner of Monica.</p>

When the rest went away they said good-bye.</p>

Everybody cannot count. An avenue goes through a city

<p>Dear Sir. Mr. Cousins told me that they were away
when it happened. They recollected being asked if they
were well if they had recovered from their emotion.
They were also asked if their wives and children were
well. They certainly did not know how to say excuse me
I do not know who you are. They might have said I
would wish to know your name because it would not be
right not to be able to give your message and if we do
not know your name we cannot say from whom the
message came.</p>

<p>This was not done.</p>

differs. Some are inclined to ratify the use of it
others prefer to ask what is a citizen. A citizen is one
who employing all the uses of his nature cleans the world
of adjoining relations. In this way we cannot conquer.
We do conquer and I ask how, how do you do.</p>

be young and unmarried and then you can not do as you
please. You can not go where you please. He believed
that it was alright. I am certain that he understood
talking. He also laughed. I am not convinced that
ploughing is safe. Ploughing is done with a plough and
under a tree. Dogs bark, little dogs bark the horse and

<p class="no-indent">Henrietta. The difference between us is that we know
what we want.</p>

<p>Oh do you.</p>

<p>Henrietta knows.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Henrietta. Why are you shutting the door.</p>

<p>Because it is the habit. It really isn't necessary.</p>

<p>Then why do you do it.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Henrietta. Every one knows William and Monica.</p>

<p>Yes and every one knows how they started.</p>

<p>How did they start.</p>

<p>By quarreling with their landlord.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Indeed yes.</p>

<p>It was not a comfortable house in summer.</p>

<p>They knew this.</p>

<p>No they didn't.</p>

<p>You are quite right they didn't.</p>

<p>The day I was settled down to making a fire I found

<p>I didn't leave you.</p>

<p>What did you wish of him.</p>

<p>I wish to tell him that I don't want my packages open.</p>

<p>That I understood.</p>

<p>Two Englishmen have searched for a Polish flag.
They found it not the flag of the nation the flag of war

<p>Clarence for a change.</p>

<p>If you have as vacation one day a month and you
take it every six months you have six days vacation.
In those six days you can visit your family in the country
or you can work in your garden or you can make changes
in the position of the wall you can do all this and then
there will be six days in six months. If you are not able
to be about this will be counted off of the days.</p>

<p>The french language.</p>

<p>Who is it.</p>

<p>What was I saying.</p>

<p>You were saying that you were able to be at home.</p>

<p>Yes I am able to be at home.</p>

<p>Then this is what troubles you.</p>

<p>No it does not trouble me. It makes me realize that
I do not wish to leave.</p>

Of course you do not wish to leave.</p>

<p>Yes that was understood.</p>

<p>I was.</p>

<p>There are mountains.</p>

<p>We are really not interested in the country if there

<p>You mean salt water.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Yes we come very happily.</p>

<p>There is very good reason for suspecting Mr. Bournville.</p>

<p>Is there.</p>

<p>Yes very good reason.</p>

<p>What is the reason.</p>

<p>The real reason is that he has been incorrect.</p>

<p>How has he been incorrect.</p>

<p>He has been altogether incorrect as to the necessity
of having water.</p>

to have water.</p>

<p>So do you get up.</p>

<p>We are pleased with each other.</p>

<p>Why are you.</p>

<p>Because we are hopeful.</p>

<p>Have you any reason to be.</p>

<p>We have reason to be.</p>

<p>What is it.</p>

<p>I am not prepared to say.</p>

<p>Is there any change.</p>

<p>Naturally.</p>

<p>I know what you mean.</p>

<p>I consider that it is not necessary for me to teach
languages.</p>

<p>It would be foolish of you to.</p>

<p>It would here.</p>

<p>It would anywhere.</p>

<p>I do not care about Peru.</p>

<p>I hope you do.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Do I begin this.</p>

<p>Yes you began this.</p>

<p>Of course we did.</p>

<p>Yes indeed we did.</p>

<p>When will we speak of another.</p>

<p>Not today I assure you.</p>

<p>Yes certainly you mentioned it.</p>

<p>To another.</p>

<p>I do not wish reasons.</p>

<p>Do not tempt him.</p>

<p>This evening there was no question of temptation he was
not the least interested.</p>

<p>Neither was she.</p>

<p>Of course she wasn't.</p>

<p>It's really not necessary to ask her.</p>

<p>I found it necessary.</p>

<p>You did</p>

<p>Certainly.</p>

<p>And when have you leisure.</p>

<p>Reading and knitting.</p>

<p>Reading or knitting.</p>

<p>Reading or knitting.</p>

<p>Yes reading or knitting.</p>

<p>In the evening.</p>

<p>Actively first.</p>

<p>He was very settled.</p>

<p>Where was he settled.</p>

<p>In Marseilles.</p>

<p>I cannot understand words.</p>

<p>Cannot you.</p>

<p>You are so easily deceived you don't ask what do they
decide what are they to decide.</p>

<p>There is no reason.</p>

<p>No there is no reason.</p>

<p>We sent him into the country.</p>

<p>Was he a trouble.</p>

<p>Not at all but we thought he would be better off there.</p>

<p>Yes it isn't right to keep a large dog in the city.</p>

<p>Yes</p>

<p>Do be quick.</p>

<p>Not in breathing.</p>

<p>No you know you don't mind.</p>

<p>I don't care for a long time.</p>

<p>For a long time to pass away.</p>

<p>If you remember you will remember other things that
frighten you.</p>

<p>Will I.</p>

<p>Yes and there is no necessity the explanation is not in
your walking first of walking last of walking beside me

<p class="center">Genevieve, Mrs. Marchand and Count Daisy Wrangel.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Mrs. Marchand.) Where was she born and with whom
did she go to school. Did she know the Marquise of
Bowers then or did she not. Did she come to know her
in Italy. Did she learn English in Morocco. She has
never been to England nor did she go to school in
Florence. She lived in the house with the friends of the
count Berny and as such she knew them and she knew
him. She went to eat an Arab dinner.</p>

<p>How did she come to know the people she has known.
I do not understand it.</p>

<p>With whom did she go to school. We are not sure.
When did she first know about Morocco. Where did
she hear English.</p>

<p>She heard English spoken to children.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Count Daisy Wrangel.) He speaks English very well.
He has an impediment in his speech. He likes cauliflower
and green peas. He does not find an old woman satisfactory
as a cook. He wishes for his Italian. It is too
expensive to bring her down. He does like dogs. He
once had eight. They were black poodles. They were
living in a garden on a duchess' estate. He trained them
to be very willing and he has pictures of them all. He
has often written a book. He writes about art sometimes.
He also paints a little. He has a friend who paints a
picture every morning and paints a picture every afternoon.
He is not disagreeable. He did not come with him.
He asked to see the dog he thought he had grown.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Genevieve.) She believes in Fraconville. What is a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_263" title="263"> </a>thunder storm. This is my history. I worked at a cafe
in Rennes. Before that I was instructed by a woman
who knew knitting and everything. My mother and
father worked at gardening. I was ruined by a butcher.
I am not particularly fond of children. My child is a
girl and is still a little one. She is living in an invaded
district but is now in Avignon. I had a coat made for
her but it did not fit her very well and now I am sending
the money so that it will be made at Verdun. I am not
necessarily a very happy woman. Every one is willing.
I like knitting and I like to buy provision. Yes I enjoy
the capital. There is plenty of meat here. I do not care
for the variety. I prefer veal to chicken. I prefer
mutton. I understand that it is difficult to have anything.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Mrs. Marchand.) I do not write often. I say I will
mention it if a man pays attention to a woman and so I
can and I can say that I have not written. I will do as
I like. I find that my baby is very healthy. I hope he
will not talk the language spoken here but I can not say
this to him. He is too young. He is not walking. If the
Dardenelles are not taken perhaps they will open. I hear
myself speaking. I have an orange tree that is open.
The sun comes in. For ten days during ten days it rains
and then until December we will have good weather.
There is no fire in the house. I do not like to look at that
map. Will you excuse me while I give my baby his
luncheon.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Count Daisy Wrangel.) It is the same name as an
island. We were from Courland and some are Russians
and some are Prussians and some are Swedes. None are
Lithuanians. Mr. Berenson is a Lithuanian. I have a
Danish friend who has been married four times. His last
wife is a singer. She is a married woman. His first
wife has been married to four different men. She has
been a good friend to each one of them. They do say this.
I have no pleasure in my stay on the Island because I
do not eat anything. I would like to have something.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_264" title="264"> </a>
(Genevieve.) The count was here. He wanted to see
the dog and he said he would like to see him. He was
not very well. He had been suffering. He did not say
that his friend would come with him. He said he thought
not. I am often told that the french are everything.
I ask do you believe that the french are winning. I
believe that the french are winning. Do you need butter
for cooking.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Mrs. Marchand.) Let me give you a peach that is
softer. Do you like this one. We will come again for
an evening. This is the shortest way. Yes I like walking.
We say very little when we are worrying. Let us go
away. We cannot because my husband cannot go away.</p>

<p class="center"><ins title="Nellie,">Nellie</ins> Mildred and Carrie.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Nellie.) Handwriting is not curving. It is not a disappointment
or a service it is frequently prepossessing.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Mildred.) It is copied. Six handkerchiefs. Two of
one kind four of another.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Carrie.) She backhands that means she takes good
care of herself.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Mrs. Marchand.) She does not know any of them.
She knows Mr. Rothschild.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Genevieve.) What is the use of being tranquil when
this house is built for the winter. The winter here is
warm.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Count Daisy Wrangel.) He will not stay longer than
November.</p>

<p class="center">William and Mary.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(William.) He is fond of reading and drinking. He
drinks wine. He also drinks siphon. This is water with
sterilised water in it. He drinks it with and also without
lemon. He is very fond of walking. He does not prefer
resting. He is a painter by profession.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Mary.) Mary is winning. She has a brother who is
fighting. He has made a ring for her. She has a mother
and another brother. We were asked does she like
swimming. She has not a knowledge of swimming.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_265" title="265"> </a>
(<ins title="Mrs.">Mrs</ins> Marchand.) She is a large woman and rather
walking. She walks along. We met her and Mr. Marchand
who were walking. We said it was too cold for
walking.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(The English consul.) All right. The dog is too closely
muzzled. He can't breathe properly.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Count Daisy Wrangel.) Why do you all speak to me.
Let me tell about it. In coming into the first office I first
saw one young lady. I told her she was looking very
well. I then went out and came back and went up to the
other lady. I said how do you do I was sorry not to see
you the other day. You were out when I called. My
friend is a bear. I thought he would have come with me
to call. I will come soon again.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Mrs. Marchand.) I don't know him very well that is
to say my husband has pointed him out to me and I knew
he was here. It will not be a disappointment to us.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Genevieve.) I prefer a basket to a mesh. It is the
one souvenir that I will have. I do not wish to say that
I am not pleased. I do not like to spend 35 dollars over
again all over again. It is exact enough.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Count Daisy Wrangel.) There is a great deal to write
in a newspaper.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Michael.) Michael was the son of Daniel. He moved
into a house. He had been living at a hotel a whole
winter. He has steam heat and light. We have not seen
photographs of the place.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Jane.) I have five children the youngest is three years
old. Many of them died.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Felix.) What kind of wool do you prefer black or in
color, heavy or thin and for what use do you desire it.
Do you also wish knitting needles and what thickness.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Alice.) What did we have to eat today. We had
very young pork. It is very delicious. I have never
eaten it better.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Genevieve.) I like to choose my meat.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Mrs. Marchand.) I understand everything better. I
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_266" title="266"> </a>like to have to think and look at maps. I hate to see so
much black. I do not mean by that that I am sullen.
I am not that. I am delighted with surroundings.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Genevieve.) I wish to spend a little money on some
things. I am waiting for the boat. I have nothing to do
except sleep. Really not.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Mrs. Marchand.) I understand Spanish.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Count Daisy Wrangel.) To please him and to please
me I do not dine at home.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Harry Francis.) It hangs out in the rain and it is
not dry what shall I put on underneath.</p>

<p>Anything you like.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Roger Henry.) Why do you prefer a picture of a boat.</p>

<p>Because it is useful.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Mrs. Marchand.) I am so disappointed in the morning.</p>

<p>We are all of us disappointed.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Mrs. Marchand.) I did not meet you to-day.</p>

<p>Yes you did.</p>

<p>Every man swallowing. What.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Mrs. Marchand.) I told you that you had every reason
to expect warm weather and now it's cold.</p>

<p>It won't be cold long I hope. These are equinoxial
storms. They last from seven to ten days.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(The English Consul.) He has had some trying experiences
but he has a pleasant home. He has a view of the
sea and also of the woods. It is natural that he has
chosen that house.</p>

<p class="no-indent">(Mrs. Marchand.) I have met her. She is very pleasant.
I did not think she was his wife. I thought she
was his daughter.</p>

<p>So did we all.</p>

<h2><a name="HE_SAID_IT">HE SAID IT<br/>
<small>MONOLOGUE</small></a></h2></div>


<p>Spoken.</p>

<p>In English.</p>

<p>Always spoken.</p>

<p>Between them.</p>

<p>Why do you say yesterday especially.</p>

<p>Why do you say by special appointment is it a mistake
is it a great mistake. This I know. What are and
beside all there is a desire for white handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>You shall have it.</p>

<p>This is what we give. We give it with a hat. Dear
me. A great many people are precious. Are they. I do
not ask the question.</p>

<p>This is my fright.</p>

<p>Oh dear Oh dear I thought the fire was out.</p>

<p>I consider it very healthy to eat sugared figs not
pressed figs I do not care for pressed figs.</p>

<p>I consider it necessary to eat sugared prunes and an
apple. I have felt it to be the only advice I could give.
It has been successful. I really feel great satisfaction
in the results. No one can say that short hair is
unbecoming.</p>

<p>What are the obligations of maternity. Reading and
sleeping. Also copying. Yes thank you.</p>

<p>Are you pleased.</p>

<p>I am not pleased.</p>

<p>I am delighted.</p>

<p>It has been a very fruitful evening.</p>

<p>It is not very likely she was pleased.</p>

<p>Pleasures of the chase. Do you like flags. I believe
in painting them. I also inquire as to their origin. Are
they simple in color or have they various designs.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_268" title="268"> </a>Nobody can be as pleased as I am can be more pleased
than I am. I am further delighted with the social relation
I have established with a great many acquaintances.
I began by intending to change to change the method
of branching. I do not find it distinguished. Then I
found that by choosing and asking other people to supply
I could be satisfied. This is history.</p>

<p>Did he see he would kill a rabbit. Many rabbits
are troublesome. I do not care to eat the one he was to
give us.</p>

<p>You do not care to eat rabbit.</p>

<p>Who is our well-wisher. I see clearly that you have
made a mistake. You have answered me defiantly. I
have not.</p>

<p>Large spaces of time are filled by my telling how
to sing.</p>

<p>How do you sing.</p>

<p>Some sing so well they laugh.</p>

<p>Others sing so well that they are roses.</p>

<p>I was very pleased with embroidery very very pleased
with embroidery.</p>

<p>Indeed.</p>

<p>Indeed I think alone.</p>

<p>And make lists.</p>

<p>And make lists.</p>

<p>I do not make lists.</p>

<p>It is no trouble to make lists.</p>

<p>I feel an infinite satisfaction in the thought that I
have stopped worrying.</p>

<p>Indeed you never worry.</p>

<p>Who can be willing to leave an American boat.</p>

<p>No one.</p>

<p>This is what I said.</p>

<p>I said it to an Englishman.</p>

<p>Governed. Do be governed.</p>

<p>I speak of this very kindly. I do not tell him about
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_269" title="269"> </a>darkness.</p>

<p>Or anybody.</p>

<p>Many people fear distraction and divert themselves
with discussion. Not I.</p>

<p>I am singularly adaptable. I have no opinion. When
I am asked I say it is distressing not to be right. It is
not distressing to me. I accomodate myself to it. I am
inclined to be talkative.</p>

<p>Are you.</p>

<p>Yes sir.</p>

<p>This is the way I say it. I ask any one to say a bowl
of water. This is not difficult. Then roses in it. I
prefer pansies. Do you. Or daisies. No we do not consider
wild flowers. This is not the reason. The real
reason is the odor. Some people like a strong odor like
china lilies or almond flowers or even tube-roses. I like
them very much. I like them all very much. Do you.</p>

<p>Yes I do.</p>

<p>The other day we saw a woman knitting she was
doing it not so very quickly and then we understood the
reason. She was knitting with cotton. That is quite the
custom of the country.</p>

<p>Why do you wish to hear it.</p>

<p>I was very pleased with this and now I want to tell
you how to do it. This is what to ask. Do you make
decorations. Do you please yourself. Are you fanciful.
Have you any use for color. Do you ask for strange
resemblances. Have you all always been merry. Do you
believe in history. Have you authority.</p>

<p>Do you expect to seem selfish. Do you. I wonder
about that.</p>

<p>Why do you talk about stretches.</p>

<p>You mean a series.</p>

<p>Yes I mean that. Do you remember that I said that.</p>

<p>What do I feel today. I feel that I do know how
to air a woman.</p>

<p>You mean that I make it too cold. Well to be sure
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_270" title="270"> </a>I am selfish I sit before the fire. I really ought to give
you the best place only I don't like to change.</p>

<p>You dear you are so sweet to me.</p>

<p>A carpet on the floor makes it a great difference.</p>

<p>Indeed there is a granite which is called marble and
rightly called marble because it is found here. Do you
know where it is made. Yes I have seen it.</p>

<p>Yes so they say.</p>

<p>Go to sleep.</p>

<p>This is my way.</p>

<p>In speaking I have a belief in saying that I said it
last.</p>

<p>Some people differ from me.</p>

<p>This is a sentence.</p>

<p>What was it she reminded me of.</p>

<p>It is satisfactory.</p>

<p>There are a great many plans. Will there be a good
<ins title="crisis">crises</ins>. I don't know. In our affairs. No the nations.
Don't speak to her of it.</p>

<p>I am not certain I like liberty.</p>

<p>Don't you.</p>

<p>Of course not.</p>

<p>We go on saying what he said.</p>

<p>I can't understand why you contradict me.</p>

<p>There we are I have a coat over my knees.</p>

<p>There is no way of speaking english. I say there
is no way of speaking English. What do you mean.
I mean that anybody can begin and go on. And finish.
It's easy enough and especially hard when there is a use.
Why do you say exchange. I do not know what they say
exchange. They say they believe in exchange. I often
talk about nothing.</p>

<p>What have I to say.</p>

<p>I wish to speak to you what shall we do about water.
The water is everywhere. Imagine me in bed. We were
very careful to ask about it.</p>

<p>Not for teeth.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_271" title="271"> </a>
Why do you talk about it not for the girl.</p>

<p>He was of course not able to pay for the concert.
He was of course not able to pay for the concert.</p>

<p>I am not talking about myself.</p>

<p>I can supply furs.</p>

<p>In summer.</p>

<p>Today.</p>

<p>It is not very cold.</p>

<p>But it will be.</p>

<p>What did he say. He said it was explanatory. I
said it was explanatory. I said I was careful of climbing.
Not into bed. Yes into bed. Why. Because you can
never tell about the slats. I remember that word.</p>

<p>What did he say today.</p>

<p>A great many mountains have seas near them.</p>

<p>And the moon. The moon has no tide.</p>

<p>When do you say that.</p>

<p>Every night.</p>

<p>Why.</p>

<p>Because I have never seen so much moonlight.</p>

<p>I feel it very much.</p>

<p>A great many people were listening. To your getting
angry</p>

<p>Talking about feeling.</p>

<p>This afternoon we went to New York and we spent
the day together. We said which way shall we walk.</p>

<p>In reading the papers I am often struck with the
different way I am impressed with the news. Should
I be cheerful. I should not. Mr. Sandling says that I
am. Indeed I am.</p>

<p>We do not expect it today. Let us go to Soller.</p>

<p>All of you hear me.</p>

<p>I like to see the rocks I mean stones.</p>

<p>I didn't mean it about the clock.</p>

<p>Here we are.</p>

<p>Mrs. misses kisses.</p>

<p>Misses kisses most.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_272" title="272"> </a>
I do like to say that.</p>

<p>Do you wish you had said it first. Not exactly. I
repeat more often. A great many people hear you.
Not now.</p>

<p>All about the swing. Swing where. In a lamp.
You mean electricity. Yes I mean electricity. Wax.</p>

<p>Do read to me.</p>

<p>We went down to the town and we met Mr. and
Mrs. Somaillard. We drank something there and we
said if they would wait we would call for them in a
carriage. We had several things to attend to first.</p>

<p>I nearly said it together.</p>

<p>Do I think that they will.</p>

<p>Do little walks tire you.</p>

<p>Dear Sir. This is the end of the day and I am able
to explain that a great deal of trouble has been taken.</p>

<p>I feel that there must be a regular time for the
oranges.</p>

<p>Oh yes indeed.</p>

<p>Never have I seen so many trees.</p>

<p>It was a surprise to you.</p>

<p>I say that I am certain that a great many things
can be said.</p>

<p>Call it a fan love.</p>

<p>I don't care to see pieces.</p>

<p>Don't you.</p>

<p>Indeed you don't.</p>

<p>Leaving stones aside what do you think of the
weather and the country.</p>

<p>I think them both delightful.</p>

<p>So do I.</p>

<p>And we enjoy ourselves.</p>

<p>Oh very much.</p>

<p>Yes and what time do you wake up.</p>

<p>At half past seven.</p>

<p>I don't wake up till nine.</p>

<p>What is the date today.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_273" title="273"> </a>
Wishes</p>

<p>He wishes to think.</p>

<p>Do not distress them.</p>

<p>What we do is this we give it to them.</p>

<p>What did he say.</p>

<p>He said he expected to be ill. He said he said he
expected not to be very well. Yes Mr. Lindo Webb.</p>

<p>Yes Mrs.</p>

<p>You should always speak the name.</p>

<p>I don't feel that I can mention it.</p>

<p>Do you believe in me.</p>

<p>Are you surprised that you have gone so far.</p>

<p>To me not to me.</p>

<p>Insulting yes she is insulting she asks have we ever
heard of a poet named Willis.</p>

<p>Alice has. I have not. She says he belonged to a
group. Like Thoreau.</p>

<p>I am not displeased with the remark.</p>

<p>Did we see the festivity. Water is amusing.</p>

<p>Do I want to go away.</p>

<p>No indeed I do not want to go away.</p>

<p>Two months.</p>

<p>In two months.</p>

<p>Politely miss me.</p>

<p>Call what.</p>

<p>Call Milly.</p>

<p>Don't you understand the difference.</p>

<p>He wanted fifty dollars for six days.</p>

<p>We did not refuse a visit.</p>

<p>No one refuses a visit.</p>

<p>I do.</p>

<p>I see.</p>

<p>A little finish. What was that noise.</p>

<p>I am very pleased to have a good fire.</p>

<p>Here are my stars and stripes.</p>

<p>Yes it's the flag.</p>

<p>What time is it.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_274" title="274"> </a>
Day time.</p>

<p>Of course and the morning.</p>

<p>I always go well prepared.</p>

<p>Of course you would.</p>

<p>What do I think.</p>

<p>Is not this certain.</p>

<p>What.</p>

<p>That there are a great many places where one would
not be as comfortable.</p>

<p>Where we would not be so comfortable.</p>

<p>Certainly I don't deny that.</p>

<p>We have been so happy here. Yes but that has
nothing to do with the people. No it hasn't. But I like
to see what I see here. You know perfectly well you
will be just as well pleased with something else.</p>

<p>Why do mules go together. Because those people
are religious. They are very religious. Were you invited.</p>

<p>Then I will finish it here.</p>

<p>This is very easy to please. Cups and saucers altogether.</p>

<p>We are going to have a picnic. With chicken not
today today we are going to have eggs and salad and
vegetables and brown bread and what else. False
smuggled contraband tobacco. You mean by that that
it isn't tobacco. No it's only leaves. I laugh.</p>

You mean in stages. No of course not in selections.
What have you selected. Very good sponges. But they
are expensive. They are not necessarily cheap. We feel
that they ask an extraordinary price here. You have
every reason to suppose so. We were quite sure of it.
It is easily understood they are accustomed to trading.
You mean barter. No I don't mean that I mean metal
worker. Metal workers have new clothes. In Palma.
Yes in Palma. I did not mean to mention that name.
Why do you dislike the town. Not at all.</p>

No one can say that Catholics are proud.</p>

<p>Why do you sell your name so.</p>

<p>I do not.</p>

<p>Of course you do.</p>

<p>You mean to.</p>

<p>You ask every one about a train.</p>

<p>We were ashamed about the train.</p>

<p>Were you.</p>

<p>Yes we had reason to be.</p>

<p>I can understand. You can understand everything.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>About the iron of course.</p>

<p>When you come to choose dishes you should remember
that they cure the ham themselves that is smoke it.</p>

<p>Oh yes.</p>

<p>She was right. Not about the whole. She knows

<p>Not in this country.</p>

<p>Donna Pilar. Is that cheese.</p>

<p>Yes it's very good cheese.</p>

<p>How do you prepare it.</p>

<p>With cognac.</p>

<p>When they were younger there may have been three
of them sisters, and a mother. When they were younger
there may have been three of them one of them a brother,
and a mother. When they were younger there were
certainly two of them, sisters, and a mother. There was
not then any father. There may have been a father
living but certainly he was not then living with them.
Anyway there were when they were younger two of
them, two sisters, and a mother.</p>

<p>Perhaps the sister who was older then supported her
sister and her mother. Perhaps she earned a living then
for all of them. She was much older than her sister,
enough older so that she could be quite certain that all
her living her sister was much younger, that all her living
her sister was a young one, that all her living she was
earning her living, that all her living her sister was not
earning her living.</p>

<p>The sister the younger one was earning her living and
certainly then the older one, the one who was much older
than her sister who was much younger was certain that
the younger one would have been earning her living all
her living if she had been one commencing to earn her
living. The younger was earning her living, she was not
listening then to the story which was distressing of the
older sister then almost not earning any living. She
would listen sometime to this thing but certainly she
would not listen then to this thing.</p>

<p>The older sister had not then any longer any mother.
The younger sister then had not then any longer any
mother. The older sister then had not then any longer
any mother. The younger sister was not then hearing
about this thing about the older sister having then not
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_332" title="332"> </a>any longer any mother. Not any one then was listening
to this thing to the older sister not then having any longer
any mother. The older sister was then quite an old
person. The younger sister was then not a young person.
The younger sister was not then hearing anything about
this thing about the older sister having then not any longer
any mother.</p>

<p>They were then being living and very many knew
them then, two of them, they were sisters, one was older,
much older, the other was younger, some younger. They
were living together then. The older was then earning
some living, the younger was then sometimes hearing
this thing, the younger was then not such a young one,
she was quite completely hearing this thing, hearing that
the older was almost earning a living, they were both
living then, the younger was hearing then that the older
one was almost earning a living. The younger was not
listening, any more then, the older one was not earning
any more of a living then. The younger one was almost
not listening then.</p>

<p>The younger then earned her living. She was not at
all a young one. The older one was not a very old
person then, she was an old person then, she was almost
not earning a living then. The younger one was not
listening then to anything about any such thing then. She
was not listening then and certainly the older one was not
listening then and certainly neither of them was listening
then. The older was almost not earning a living then
and she was quite old then and she was not listening then.
The younger one was earning a living then and was not
listening then and she was not at all a young one then.</p>

<p>The older one was protecting the younger one from
knowing where they had been when they were young
ones. They both knew where they had been when they
were young ones. The younger one was protected for
this thing for not knowing where they had been when
they were young ones.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_333" title="333"> </a>
The younger one was protected. She was protected
from knowing that they were ones having been living
when they were young ones, she was protected from
knowing that they were not ever completely earning a
living, she was protected from knowing that they were
not going to be succeeding in earning a living. She was
protected from these things, really she was protected
from these things. Certainly every one knew everything,
both of them and every one knowing them knew everything.
That was a natural thing that every one should
know everything. In a way they were succeeding in
living. In a way the older one was succeeding in living,
in a way the younger one was succeeding in living.
Everybody knew everything, anybody knowing them
knew everything, everybody knowing them knew it again
and again, knew everything again and again, the older
one knew everything knew it again and again. The
younger one knew everything knew it again and again.
Certainly every one knew everything. Certainly every
one knew everything again and again.</p>

<p>The older one succeeded very well in living. The
younger one succeeded very well in living. The older
one was successful in being living. The younger one was
successful in being living. The older one came to be
certain that she was not successful in being living, that
she was not succeeding in living, she came to be certain
that the younger one would have been successful in living
if the older one had not been one protecting the younger
one from knowing this thing. The older one came to
be certain that she had been successful in living, that she
would not be succeeding in living. The older one came to
be certain that the younger one would not really be
succeeding in living. The younger one came to be certain
that the older one could have been succeeding in living.
The younger one came to be certain that the older one
would not be succeeding in living. The younger one came
to be certain that she could be succeeding in living. The
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_334" title="334"> </a>younger one came to be certain that it would not be an
easy thing to keep on being succeeding in living. The
<ins title="younger one">younger</ins> came to be certain that the older one never had
been keeping on succeeding in living. The younger one
was certain that one could keep on succeeding in living
but that this was not an easy thing.</p>

<p>The older sister was not ever married. The younger
sister was not ever married. This is quite common, not
being married. The older sister was one whom some
were certain could have been married very often. Certainly
if she had been a little different she might have
been married again and again. Certainly she was never
married. Certainly she was not needing that thing, needing
being married, needing being married again and again.
She certainly was talking about any such thing, talking
very often about any such thing about any being married,
about any being married again and again. She certainly
was one knowing very many men. Certainly very many
men liked this woman. Certainly she was talking about
this thing about being married very often, certainly she
was very often talking about this thing. Certainly she
was not ever completely needing this thing, needing
marrying, she certainly was not ever completely needing
marrying again and again. She was never a married one.
She was not ever completely needing this thing. Certainly
she could think again and again of this thing, of
marrying. She certainly did think about this thing about
marrying. She certainly did talk about marrying again
and again. She certainly did feel something about this
thing about marrying again and again.</p>

<p>The younger sister was never married and she might
sometime have come to be married and she did not come
at any time to be married. She was never married. She
might talk about this thing about marrying. She might
feel something about this thing about marrying. She
might completely need this thing, need being married.
She might have come to be a married one. She did not
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_335" title="335"> </a>come to be a married one. Her sister was not ever certain
that she would come to be a married one, that she
would not come to be a married one. Her sister was not
certain about either of them that they would never come
to be married ones. They were never married neither
the one nor the other and certainly each one of them
knew this thing that neither one of them had come to be
a married one.</p>

<p>Certainly the older one had done something and
certainly every one was content to tell about this thing
about her having done something and being one every one
knowing her was remembering as having been one doing
something. She certainly had done something and certainly
any one knowing her remembered that thing remembered
that she was one having done something. She
was one going on doing that thing and certainly every
one knowing her knew that thing knew that she was
going on doing that thing. She was one having done
something and doing that thing and certainly any one
knowing her remembered that thing. It was a natural
thing to remember that thing, any one, every one remembered
that thing.</p>

<p>She was one doing something and certainly in a way
she was not getting old in doing that thing and certainly
in a way she was completely old in doing that thing, she
was not doing that thing she was so old in doing that
thing. In a way she was not old in doing that thing, in
doing anything and certainly then she was completely
old and not really to any one doing that thing. She was
not old in doing that thing, that is to say she was doing
that thing, that is to say if not anything had been changing
she would not have been old in doing that thing. In a
way somethings are not changing and so in a way she was
not old in doing that thing. Certainly to those being then
doing that thing and not being old then anything is a
changed thing and certainly then she was old in doing
that thing.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_336" title="336"> </a>
She was not old in being living that is to say as not
anything is changing she was completely not old in being
living. She was pretty nearly old in being living that is
to say she was not young in being living that is to say
some were old in being living and she was talking to
them and they were understanding and some were young
in being living and they were telling something and she
was certain they were not telling any such thing. She
certainly was not old in being living. She certainly was
not young in being living.</p>

<p>The younger one was certainly not an old one. She
certainly was not such a young one. In a way she was
certainly a young one and certainly she was such a one
in not hearing some things and in telling some things and
certainly this did not astonish any one and was a natural
thing and certainly she was not then a young one.</p>

<p>She was an older one and she was certain of this
thing and this was not an astonishing thing to any one
and not to her sister who was not astonished at her being
a younger one at her being an older one but was certainly
hoping to have had this thing happening that the younger
one would have been going on being a younger one and
being an older one and not be remembering anything of
any such thing. Certainly the younger one came to be
one almost liking to be remembering something and then
again she certainly came to be quite tired of doing this
thing of remembering anything, of remembering being
an older one and remembering being a younger one and
then she came to going on being one remembering
being an older one, she was then remembering being a
younger one. Certainly she came to be remembering
pretty nearly everything and to going on in this thing,
keeping going on in this thing, steadily enough going on
in this thing.</p>

<p>They could both of them, they did, both of them,
they would, either of them, know that they were ones
having been together and they were ones having been
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_337" title="337"> </a>alone. The older one certainly was one having been
alone, being alone, going to be alone and certainly this
thing was something that she was certain she was completely
needing, was something she was certain she was
completely regretting, was something that certainly she
was one certain she could be feeling and certainly she was
feeling this thing and certainly she would be one having
been feeling this thing and certainly she could never be
not feeling that this was something that was a thing she
was needing, she was regretting, in which she was suffering,
in which she was glorying, in which she was believing,
in which she was despairing, in which and by which she
was really being living.</p>

<p>The younger one was alone and not feeling about this
thing that it was an important thing, she was feeling
about this thing that it was a thing that she was needing
to be changing. The older one was quite certain that
the younger would never be changing anything. The
younger one was not certain whether she would or
whether she would not be changing anything but this
was not to be an important thing, the important thing
for her was to be one living where she wanted to be
living and to be working if she needed to be working.
Certainly her sister was one to whom any such thing was
an important thing and so the younger one did not tell
her sister anything about this thing until she had changed
everything, that is gone to where she wanted to and
working because she had to.</p>

<p>So each of them were ones being not living with any
one and certainly the older one had that then as an important
thing in being one being living.</p>

<p>Certainly any one could know that having been being
living was an interesting thing in knowing the older one.
Any one could know this thing could know that the older
one had been one being living and that that was an interesting
thing. She certainly had been one being living and
that certainly was an interesting thing. She had been being
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_338" title="338"> </a>living and this had been going on a very long time and
it was all that time and later then a very interesting thing.
She was being living and this was then to her then an
important thing and not then so completely interesting.
The younger one had been being living and this was to
some an important enough thing and was to some quite an
important thing and was not to any one a very interesting
thing not to the older one either or to the other one
herself who was one doing that living. They certainly
had been both being living and were then being living.
Certainly having been being living was an important thing
was a completely interesting thing, any one could know
that thing, certainly the older one could know that thing,
certainly the younger one was not remembering that
thing.</p>

<p>They had been together, they were together, they
were not together. When they had been together the
older one was almost completely succeeding in being one
naturally needing that the younger one was something
any one would be protecting. The older one was then
going to be one being completely interesting in having
been living. The older one was then almost completely
brilliantly this thing being one being completely interesting
in having been living. The older one was completely
then succeeding in this thing in being one going to be
interesting in having been living, in being one needing
that any one would have been protecting the younger one.
They had been together. They were together. When they
were together the older one was almost needing that any
one would be certain to be doing that thing certain to be
sometime protecting the younger one. The older one was
then certainly completely interesting in having been living
and certainly then was completely interesting. She was
almost then, was almost brilliantly succeeding in this
thing in being completely interesting in having been living.
Certainly they were both being living then and they were
together then. Certainly then the older one was going
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_339" title="339"> </a>on in being interesting in having been living, she certainly
was then quite completely interesting. She certainly then
was being living and certainly then she was almost certain
that any one would be one to protect the younger one.
They were together then and certainly some were not
certain of this thing that any one would sometime protect
the younger one. They were together then and every one
was certain that the older one was completely interesting
in having been living. They were together then and some
were not certain that the older one was certain that any
one would be protecting the younger one. Some were
certain then that the older one was interesting in having
been living. They were together then and any one could be
certain that not every one would ever protect the younger
one when the younger one would be needing any protection.
Some were certain that the older one was not
certain that any one would protect the younger one when
the younger one would need protection. The older was
almost certain that some one would protect the younger
one when the younger one would need protection. The
older one was almost quite certain. The older one was
almost quite completely interesting in having been one
being living. They were together. They were not together.
The older one was certain that some one would have
been protecting the younger one when they younger one
would be needing protection. The older one was certain
that sometime the younger one would be needing that
thing would be needing protection. The younger one was
not with the older one. The younger one was
remembering that she was not with the older one.
The younger one was remembering that she was not
with the older one and was needing that the
older one would be one coming sometime to remembering
that thing. The older one was pretty nearly
interesting in having been one being living. She was
pretty nearly certain that some one would have been
protecting the younger one when the younger one would
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_340" title="340"> </a>have been needing that thing. They were not together
then. The older one was pretty nearly interesting in
having been one being living. She was quite certain that
any one could have protected the younger one when the
younger one would have needed that thing. She was
almost remembering that they were not together then.
She was almost quite remembering that thing. She was
quite interesting in having been one being living. She
was almost quite interesting in having been living.</p>

<p>I was winsome. Dishonored. And a kingdom. I

They have dislikes. I dread smoke. Where are there

Her name is Antonia. She is pleased to say what will
you have. Horns and horns. Nicholas is not a stranger.
Neither is Monica. No one is a stranger. We refuse
to greet any one. We like Genevieve to satisfy us. I do
not like what I am saying.</p>

<p>How can you describe a trip. It is so boastful.</p>

<p>He said definitely that they would. They have. It's
a little late. I hope the other things will be as he states
them. I have confidence. I have not eaten peaches.
Yes I have. I apologize. I did not want to say the other
word that was red. You know what I mean.</p>

<p>Why can I read it if I know page to page what is
coming if I have not read it before. Why can I read it.
I do.</p>

<p>I didn't.</p>

<p>Let me see. I wish to tell about the door. The
door opens before the kitchen. The kitchen is <ins title="closed.">closed</ins>
The other door is open and that makes a draft. This is
very pleasant in summer. We did not expect the weather
to change so suddenly. There seem to be more mosquitoes
than ever. I don't understand why I like narrative
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_342" title="342"> </a>so much to read. I do like it. I see no necessity for
disclosing <ins title="particularity.">particularity</ins> I am mightily disturbed by a name
such as an English home. An English home is beautiful.
So are the times.</p>

<p>A dog does not bark when he hears other dogs bark.
He sleeps carefully he does not know about it. I am
not pained.</p>

<p>This is the narrative. In watching a balloon, a kite,
a boat, steps and watches, any kind of a call is remarkable
remarkably attuned. A resemblance to Lloyd George,
bequeathing prayers, saying there is no hope, having a
french meeting. Jenny said that she said that she did not
believe in her country. Any one who does not believe in
her country speaks the truth. How dare you hurt the
other with canes. I hope he killed him. Read it. I
believe Bulgaria. I have pledges. I have relief.</p>


<p class="small-capped-heading">I AM NOT PATIENT</p>

<p>I am interested. In that table. I like washing gates
with a mixture. We get it by bringing up melons. White
melons have a delicious flavor.</p>

<p>I am not patient. I get angry at a dog. I do not wish
to hear a noise. I did not mind the noise which the client
made. I wished to see the pearls. How easily we ask
for what we are going to have. By this we are pleased
and excited.</p>

<p>The hope there is is that we will hear the news.
We are all elated. Did you see her reading the paper.
I cannot help wanting to write a story.</p>

<p>A woman who had children and called to them
making them hear singing is a match for the man who
has one child and does not tell him to play there with
children. Heaps of them are gambling. They tell about
stitches. Stitches are easily made in hot weather and
vegetation. Tube roses are famous.</p>

<p>I could be so pleased. It would please me if Van
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_343" title="343"> </a>would mention it. Why is an index dear to him. He
has thousands of gesticulations. He can breathe.</p>

<p>White and be a Briton. This means a woman from
the north of France. They are very religious. They
say blue is not a water color. It should be a bay. We
are pleased with her. She washes her hair very often.</p>

<p>Do not tremble. If she had an institution it is the
one excluding her mother. Her native land is not beautiful.
She likes the poet to mutter. He does. The olive.</p>

<p>We had that impression. Do speak. Have they
been able to arrange matters with the proprietor.</p>

<p>I will not please play. I will adorn the station. It
has extraordinarily comfortable seats.</p>


<p class="small-capped-heading">TO OPEN</p>

<p>Not too long for leading, not opening his mouth and
sitting. Not bequeathing butter. Butter comes from
Brittany. In the summer it smells rancid. We do not
like it. We have ceased use of it. We find that oil does
as well. We can mix oil with butter but we have lard.
We use lard altogether. We prefer it to butter. We use
the butter in winter. We have not been using it before
the winter. We mix lard and oil. We will use butter.</p>


<p class="small-capped-heading">DO LET US BE FAITHFUL AND TRUE</p>

<p class="small-capped-heading">A GRAPE CURE</p>

<p>What did we have for dinner we had a melon lobster
chicken then beet salad and fruit. How can you tell a
melon. You tell it by weight and pressing it. You do
not make mistakes. We are pleased with it. Do we like
a large dog. Not at all.</p>

BATTLE</p>

<p>Battle creek. I was wet. All the doors showed
light. It is strange how Brittany is not attractive as
Mallorca and yet butter does make a difference. We are
perfect creatures. What is a festival. Saturday to some.
Not to be dishonored. Not to be tall and dishonored they
usually aren't but some are, some are tall and dishonored.
By this I mean that coming down the mountain faces
which are shining are reflecting the waving of the boat
which is there now. I distrust everybody. Do sleep well.
Everywhere there is a cat. We will leave by boat. I
am not pleased with this. I will get so that I can write
a story.</p>


<p class="small-capped-heading">FASTENING TUBE ROSES</p>

<p>I understand perfectly well how to fix an electric
fan. Of course it makes sparks but when the two black
pieces that do not come together are used up you get this.
I do it without any bother. I am not certain I could learn
it. It is not difficult. We do not find that it does away with
mosquitoes. We use it in the night. Sundays there is
no electricity.</p>


<p class="small-capped-heading">THEY DO IT BETTER THAN I DO</p>

<p>I can. I can be irritated. I hate lizards when you
call them crocodile. She screamed. She screamed. I
do not know why I am irritated.</p>


<p class="small-capped-heading">IT IS A NATURAL THING</p>

<p>Do not do that again. I do not like it. Please give
it away. We will not take it to Paris. I do not want the
gas stove. It has a round oven. It does not bake. We
use coal by preference. It is very difficult not to bathe
in rain water. Rain water is so delicious. It is boiled.
We boil it.</p>

LOUD LETTERS</p>

<p>Look up and not down.</p>

<p>Look right and not left.</p>

<p>And lend a hand.</p>

<p>We were so pleased with the Mallorcans and the
wind and the party. They were so good to offer us
ice-cream. They do not know the french names.</p>

<p>Isn't it peculiar that those that fear a thunder storm
are willing to drink water again and again, boiled water
because it is healthy. All the water is in cisterns rain
water. There are no vegetables that is to say no peas.
There are plenty of beets. I like them so much. So do
I melons. I was so glad that this evening William came and
ate some. It would not go back as if it hadn't been good.</p>


<p class="small-capped-heading">PLEASURES IN SINCERE WISHES</p>

<p>I wish you to enjoy these cigarettes. They are a
change from those others. I understand that you had
some very good ones. You are not able to get these any
more. I have tried to get them. They tell me that they
cannot say when they will come. They do not know
that about them. We sleep easily. We are awakened
by the same noise. It is so disagreeable.</p>


<p class="small-capped-heading">AN EXHIBITION</p>

<p>I do not quite succeed in making an exhibition.
Please place me where there is air. I like to be free.
I like to be sure that the dogs will not be worried. I
don't see how they can avoid crickets. They come in.
They are so bothersome. We must ask Polybe to wish.</p>


<p class="small-capped-heading">THE BOAT</p>

<p>I was so disappointed in the boat. It was larger
than the other. It did not have more accomodation.
It made the noise which was disagreeable. I feel that
I would have been willing to say that I liked it very well
if I had not seen it when it was painted. It is well never
to deceive me.</p>

<p class="small-capped-heading">PRESENT</p>

<p>This is a ceremonial. When you are bashful you do
not think. When a present is offered you accept it you
accept the bracelet worn by the nun so that it rusted.
You do not know what to do with it. You describe its
qualities. It is a pleasure to have it. You will give it.
You are steadily tender. You say the beginning is best.
Why do you say Englishman. You say Englishman
because he wished it. Do not hurry.</p>


<p class="small-capped-heading">EVIAN WATER</p>

<p>Evian water is very good. Sometimes I am not sure
it is put up by them at least now when there is a war.
I say it is fresh. When I do not like a bottle I throw

<p>We were using the end that is by the fire and now
that we have good coal I am beginning to separate expenses.
I do see shell fish. It is a mistake to recollect all
of it very nearly. I had better undertake to measure
out a real wood and to borrow little pieces. It was
chosen by me. I spoke to a man. He said he would come
at once. I said no wait until you finish dinner. He
mentioned that the soup was so hot he would prefer
that it should cool. I said I would not allow it, that I
would be uncomfortable and that there was no hurry I
left no one. I never see fire, Mr. Matisse, Mr. Julian,
Mr. Meininger, Mrs. Walter and Miss Howard without
thinking of it. By nearly wishing for a country by nearly
wishing for a country, by this you will spoil her. Do you.
Do you ask for Greek. Do you deny Spain. Do you
not praise England. Do you prize England. I said that
I believed in the country and that I was silent in the city.
I said I was silent about the city, I said I believed in the
country. He asked me why I reigned. I said I did not
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_371" title="371"> </a>deny rain. I said he could promise his mother. When
the whole arrangement was mentioned leaving out pieces
of plaster, when the whole thing was mentioned and he
did not recommend oil, he did not say that he had not
made an attempt, he said it was useless at this time to
ask a minister to serve an individual. He said they were
too busy. He said he would not speak to one another.
He said I will ask.</p>

<p>I am trying a new one.</p>


<p class="center heading-space">Believe two names.</p>

<p>I am really surprised.</p>

<p>In my surprise I shall stammer.</p>

<p>I do not stammer ordinarily.</p>

<p>Widening putty is not lonesome. It makes a door.
I was wondering if the door was wide enough and if not
whether the double door would be broken. It certainly
would be and now if it were there would be no reparation.
Not by reason of not inclining to mend it but because
of the time that is only shown by the absence of women.
It is astonishing. Really it is astonishing and its true.
We have found it out. The day that we asked we heard
it. We were surprised. If I wanted the door there is yet
to be found the man who makes plaster. Plaster,
cement. We say cement.</p>

<p>I am disappointed in women. No I cannot say that.
There are ten days. I will be so pleased. I am so

<p>Once when I was fastening a drawing, I fastened
it with decision. I did not like it there. We have decided
not to have an umbrella stand. I don't think either
that we will put everything away, I think what we will
decide is this, to meet the train, to insist on paying, to
give four eggs, bread, butter, water, meat and pears.
Then we will go away and after that I don't think there
is any need to notice noise. It is so silvery. I mentioned
a fork. We were astonished by all languages. I meant

do not deceive anybody, do not be churlish. Do place

I shall suggest it. Very likely there is cause. I don't
say I neglect to mention it. I forgot to place any of it

I shall judge then. Do not go away. This is this call.

<p>If you had three husbands, well not exactly that.</p>

<p>If you had three husbands would you be willing to
take everything and be satisfied to live in Belmont in a
large house with a view and plenty of flowers and neighbors,
neighbors who were cousins and some friends who
did not say anything.</p>

<p>This is what happened.</p>

<p>She expressed everything.</p>

<p>She is worthy of signing a will.</p>

<p>And mentioning what she wished.</p>

<p>She was brought up by her mother. She had meaning
and she was careful in reading. She read marvelously.
She was pleased. She was aged thirty-nine. She
was flavored by reason of much memory and recollection.</p>

<p>This is everything.</p>


<p class="center heading-space">Foreword.</p>

<p>I cannot believe it.</p>

<p>I cannot realize it.</p>

<p>I cannot see it.</p>

<p>It is what happened.</p>

<p>First there was a wonder.</p>

<p>Really wonder.</p>

<p>Wonder by means of what.</p>

<p>Wonder by means of measures.</p>

<p>Measuring what.</p>

<p>Heights.</p>

<p>How high.</p>

<p>A little.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_378" title="378"> </a>
This was not all.</p>

<p>There were well if you like there were wonderful
spots such as were seen by a queen. This came to be a
system. Really it was just by a treasure. What was a
treasure. Apart from that.</p>

<p>Surely.</p>

<p>Rather.</p>

<p>In their beginning what was a delight. Not signing
papers or anything or indeed in having a mother and two
sisters. Not nearly enough were mentioned by telegraphing.
It was a choice.</p>

<p>I ramble when I mention it.</p>

<p>Did she leave me any money.</p>

<p>I remember something.</p>

<p>I am not clear about what it was.</p>

<p>When did I settle that.</p>

<p>I settled it yesterday.</p>


<p class="center heading-space">Early Life.</p>

<p>They were not miserably young they were older than
another. She was gliding. It is by nearly weekly leaning
that it comes to be exact. It never was in dispute.</p>

<p>They were gayly not gaily gorgeous. They were not
gorgeous at all. They were obliging. If you think so.
If you think so glow. If you believe in light boys. They
were never another.</p>

<p>It came to be seen that any beam of three rooms was
not showy. They were proud to sit at mother. Slowly
walking makes walking quicker. They have toys and not
that in deceiving. They do not deceive them. No one is
willing. No one could be cool and mother and divided
and necessary and climatical and of origin and beneath
that mean and be a sun. It was strange in her cheek.
Not strange to them or that.</p>

<p>A young one.</p>

<p>Not by mountains.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_379" title="379"> </a>
Not by oysters.</p>

<p>Not by hearing.</p>

<p>Not by round ways.</p>

<p>Not by circumference again.</p>

<p>Not by leaving luncheon.</p>

<p>Not by birth.</p>

<p>It doesn't make any difference when ten are born.
Ten is never a number. Neither is six. Neither is four.</p>

<p>I will not mention it again.</p>


<p class="center heading-space">Early days of shading.</p>

<p>Make a single piece of sun and make a violet bloom.
Early piece of swimming makes a sun on time and makes
it shine and warm today and sun and sun and not to
stay and not to stay or away. Not to stay satin. Out
from the whole wide world he chose her. Out from the
whole wide world and that is what is said.</p>


<p class="center heading-space">Family.</p>

<p>What is famine. It is plenty of another. What is
famine. It is eating. What is famine. It is carving.
Why is carving a wonderful thing. Because supper is
over. This can happen again. Sums are seen.</p>

<p>Please be polite for mother. Lives of them. Call it
shall it clothe it. Boil it. Why not color it black and
never red or green. This is stubborn. I don't say so.</p>


<p class="center heading-space">No opposition.</p>

<p>If you had a little likeness and hoped for more terror.
If you had a refusal and were slender. If you had cuff-buttons
and jackets and really astonishing kinds of fever
would you stop talking. Would you not consider it
necessary to talk over affairs.</p>

<p>It was a chance that made them never miss tea.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_380" title="380"> </a>They did not miss it because it was there. They did not
mean to be particular. They invited their friends. They
were not aching. It was noiseless and beside that they
were clever. Who was clever. The way they had of
seeing mother.</p>

<p>Mother was prepared.</p>

<p>They were caressing.</p>

<p>They had sound sense.</p>

<p>They were questioned.</p>

<p>They had likeness. Likeness to what. Likeness to
loving. Who had likeness to loving. They had likeness
to loving. Why did they have a likeness to loving. They
had a likeness to loving because it was easily seen that
they were immeasurable.</p>

<p>They were fixed by that, they were fixed, not licensed,
they were seen, not treasured, they were
announced, not restless, they were reasoning, not progressing.
I do not wish to imply that there is any remedy
for any defect.</p>

<p>I cannot state that anyone was disappointed. I
cannot state that any one was ever disappointed by
willingly heaping much confusion in particular places.
No confusion is reasonable. Anybody can be nervous.</p>

<p>They were nervous again.</p>

<p>This is wishing.</p>

<p>Why is wishing related to a ridiculous pretence of
changing opposition to analysis. The answer to this is
that nearly any one can faint. I don't mean to say that
they don't like tennis.</p>

<p>Please be capable of sounds and shoulders. Please
be capable of careful words. Please be capable of
meaning to measure further.</p>

<p>They measured there.</p>

<p>They were heroes.</p>

have been reading.</p>

<p>What effects tenderness.</p>

<p>Not to remember the name.</p>

<p>Say it.</p>

<p>The time comes when it is natural to realize that
solid advantages connect themselves with pages of extreme
expression. This is never nervously pale. It is
finely and authentically swollen by the time there is any
rapid shouting.</p>

<p>I do not like the word shouting. I do not mean that
it gives me any pleasure. On the contrary I see that
individual annoyances are increased by it but nevertheless
I am earnestly persuasive concerning it. Why soothe why
soothe each other.</p>

<p>This is not at all what is being said.</p>

<p>It happened very simply that they were married.
They were naturally married and really the place to see
it was in the reflection every one had of not frightening
not the least bit frightening enthusiasm. They were so
exact and by nearly every one it was encouraged soothed
and lamented. I do not say that they were interested.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_382" title="382"> </a>
Any years are early years and all years are occasions
for recalling that she promised me something.</p>

<p>This is the way to write an address.</p>

<p>When they were engaged she said we are happy.
When they were married she said we are happy.
They talked about everything they talked about individual
feeling. This is not what was said. They did not talk
about disinterested obligation. They did not talk about
pleasantness and circumstances. I do not mean to say
that there was conversation. I do not organize a revision.
I declare that there was no need of criticism. That there
was no criticism. That there was breathing. By that
I mean that lights have lanterns and are not huddled
together when there is a low ceiling. By that I mean
that it was separate. The ceiling was separated from
the floor. Everywhere.</p>

<p>I could say that devotion was more merited than
walking together. What do you mean. I mean that we
all saw it.</p>

<p>When not by a beginning is there meadows and
music, you can't call it that exactly, when not by a beginning,
there is no beginning, I used to say there was a
beginning, there is no beginning, when there is no beginning
in a volume and there are parts, who can think.</p>

<p>This pencil was bought in Austria.</p>


<p class="center heading-space">Length of time or times.</p>

<p>He agreed. He said I would have known by this
time. I don't like to think about it. It would have led
to so much. Not that I am disappointed I cannot be
disappointed when I have so much to make me happy.
I know all that I am to happiness, it is to be happy and
I am happy. I am so completely happy that I mention it.</p>

<p>In writing now I find it more of a strain because now
I write by sentences. I don't mean that I feel it above,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_383" title="383"> </a>I feel it here and by this time I mention it too. I do
not feel the significance of this list.</p>

to but I was willing not quite to understand why after all
there need be poison. Do not say more than a word.</p>

<p>No this is wrong.</p>

<p>Cousins and cousins, height is a brother. Are they

<p>If you had three husbands I don't mean that it is a
guess or a wish. I believe finally in what I saw in what
I see. I believe finally in what I see, in where I satisfy
my extreme shadow.</p>

<p>Believing in an extreme dream. This is so that she
told her mother. I do not believe it can be mentioned.
I do not believe it can be mentioned.</p>

<p>When it came to say I mean a whole day nobody
meant a whole day. When it came not to say a whole
day nobody meant a whole day. There never was a
single day or a single murmur or a single word or a single

<p>When it was easy to matter we were all frames not
golden or printed, just finely or formerly flattered. It
was so easy easy to be bell. Belle was her name. Belle or
Bella. I don't mean relations or overwhelming. I don't
even mean that we were fond of healthy trees. Trees
aren't healthy by yesterday or by roots or by swelling.
Trees are a sign of pleasure. It means that there is a

<p>Saturday.</p>

<p>Pray.</p>

<p>What forsooth.</p>

<p>Do be quiet.</p>

<p>Laugh.</p>

<p>I know it.</p>

<p>Shall we.</p>

<p>Let us go ten.</p>

<p>One must be willing.</p>

<p>If one loves one another by that means they do not
perish. They frequent the same day and nearly that it
was six months apart.</p>

<p>Three and three make two.</p>

<p>Two twenty.</p>

<p>I was not disappointed.</p>

<p>Do as you please, write the name, change it, declare
that you are strong, be annoyed. All this is not foolish.</p>

<p>She was doubtless not old.</p>

<p>Pleasant days brother. I don't mean this thing. I
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_386" title="386"> </a>don't mean calling aloud, I never did so, I was not
plaintive. I was not even reached by coughing. I was
splendid and sorrowful. I could catch my breath.</p>

<p>I don't feel that necessity.</p>

<p>They came home.</p>

<p>Why did they come home.</p>

<p>They come home beside.</p>

<p>All of it was strange, their daughter was strange,
their excitement was strange and painfully sheltered.
Quiet leaning is so puzzling. Certainly glasses makes cats
a nuisance. We really have endured too much. Everybody
says the same thing.</p>

<p>I do not see much necessity for believing that it
would have occurred as it did occur if sun and September
and the hope had not been mentioned. It was all foolish.
Why not be determined. Why not oppose. Why not
settle flowers. Settle on flowers, speak cryingly and be
loath to detain her. I don't see how any one can speak.</p>

<p>I am not satisfied.</p>


<p class="center heading-space">Present Homes.</p>

<p>There then.</p>

<p>Present ten.</p>

<p>Mother and sister apples, no not apples, they can't
be apples, everything can't be apples, sounds can't be
apples. Do be quiet and refrain from acceptances.</p>

<p>It was a great disappointment to me.</p>

<p>I can see that there is a balcony. There never was a
sea or land, there never was a harbor or a snow storm,
there never was excitement. Some said she couldn't love.
I don't believe that anybody said that. I don't mean that
anybody said that. We were all present. We could be
devoted. It does make a different thing. And hair, hair
should not be deceiving. Cause tears. Why tears, why
not abscesses.</p>

<p>I will never mention an ugly skirt.</p>

<p>It pleased me to say that I was pretty.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_387" title="387"> </a>
Oh we are so pleased.</p>

<p>I don't say this at all.</p>

<p>Consequences are not frightful.</p>

<p>Pleasure in a home.</p>

<p>After lunch, why after lunch, no birds are eaten.
Of course carving is special.</p>

<p>I don't say that for candor.</p>

<p>Please be prepared to stay.</p>

<p>I don't care for wishes.</p>

<p>This is not a success.</p>

<p>By this stream.</p>

<p>Streaming out.</p>

<p>I am relieved from draught. This is not the way to
spell water.</p>

<p>I cannot believe in much.</p>

<p>I have courage.</p>

<p>Endurance.</p>

<p>And restraint.</p>

<p>After that.</p>


<p class="center heading-space">For that end.</p>

<p>This is the title of a conclusion which was not
anticipated</p>

<p>When I was last there I smiled behind the car.
What car showed it.</p>

<p>By that time.</p>

<p>Believe her out.</p>

<p>Out where.</p>

<p>By that.</p>

<p>Buy that.</p>

<p>She pleased me for. Eye saw.</p>

<p>Do it.</p>


<p class="center heading-space">For that over that.</p>

<p>We passed away. By that time servants were
memorable. They came to praise.</p>

<p>Please do not.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_388" title="388"> </a>
A blemish.</p>

<p>They have spans.</p>

<p>I cannot consider that the right word.</p>

<p>By the time we are selfish, by that time we are
selfish.</p>

<p>By that time we are selfish.</p>

<p>It is a wonderful sight,</p>

<p>It is a wonderful sight to see.</p>

<p>Days.</p>

<p>What are days.</p>

<p>They have hams.</p>

<p>Delicate.</p>

<p>Delicate hams.</p>

<p>Pounds.</p>

<p>Pounds where.</p>

<p>Pounds of.</p>

<p>Where.</p>

<p>Not butter dogs.</p>

<p>I establish souls.</p>

<p>Any spelling will do.</p>

<p>Beside that.</p>

<p>Any spelling will do beside that.</p>

<p>If you look at it.</p>

<p>That way.</p>

<p>I am going on.</p>

<p>In again.</p>

<p>I am going on again in in then.</p>

<p>What I feel.</p>

<p>What I do feel.</p>

<p>They said mirrors.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly they have that phrase.</p>

<p>I can see a hat.</p>

<p>I remember very well knowing largely.</p>

<p>Any shade, by that I do mean iron glass. Iron glass
is so torn. By what. By the glare. Be that beside. Size
shall be sensible. That size shall be sensible.</p>


<p class="center heading-space"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_389" title="389"> </a>
Fixing.</p>

<p>Fixing enough.</p>

<p>Fixing up.</p>

<p>By fixing down, that is softness, by fixing down there.</p>


<p class="center heading-space">Their end.</p>

<p>Politeness.</p>

<p>Not by linen.</p>

<p>I don't wish to be recalled.</p>

<p>One, day, I do not wish to use the word, one day
they asked to buy that.</p>

<p>I don't mean anything by threads. It was wholly
unnecessary to do so. It was done and then a gun. By
that stand. Wishes.</p>

<p>I do not see what I have to do with that.</p>

<p>Any one can help weeping.</p>

<p>By wise.</p>

<p>I am so indifferent.</p>

<p>Not a bite.</p>

<p>Call me handsome.</p>

<p>It was a nice fate.</p>

<p>Any one could see.</p>

<p>Any one could see.</p>

<p>Any one could see.</p>

<p>Buy that etching.</p>

<p>Do be black.</p>

<p>I do not mean to say etching. Why should I be very
sensitive. Why should I matter. Why need I be seen.
Why not have politeness.</p>

<p>Why not have politeness.</p>

<p>In my hair.</p>

<p>I don't think it sounds at all like that.</p>

<p>Their end.</p>

<p>To end.</p>

<p>To be for that end.</p>

<p>To be that end.</p>

<p>I don't see what difference it makes</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_390" title="390"> </a>
It does matter.</p>

<p>Why have they pots.</p>

<p>Ornaments.</p>

<p>And china.</p>

<p>It isn't at all.</p>

<p>I have made every mistake.</p>

<p>Powder it.</p>

<p>Not put into boxes.</p>

<p>Not put into boxes.</p>

<p>Powder it.</p>

<p>I know that well.</p>

<p>She mentioned it as she was sleeping.</p>

<p>She liked bought cake best. No she didn't for that
purpose.</p>

<p>I have utter confusion.</p>

<p>No two can be alike.</p>

<p>They are and they are not stubborn.</p>

<p>Please me.</p>

<p>I was mistaken.</p>

<p>Any way.</p>

<p>By that.</p>

<p>Do not refuse to be wild.</p>

<p>Do not refuse to be all.</p>

<p>We have decided not to withstand it.</p>

<p>We would not rather have the home.</p>

<p>This is to teach lessons of exchange endurance
and resemblance and by that time it was turned.</p>

<p>Shout.</p>

<p>By.</p>

<p>Out.</p>

<p>I am going to continue humming.</p>

<p>This does not mean express wishes.</p>

<p>I am not so fanciful. I am beside that calculated
to believe in whole pages. Oh do not annoy me.</p>

<p>Days.</p>

<p>I don't like to be fitted. She didn't say that. If it
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_391" title="391"> </a>hadn't been as natural as all the rest you would have been
as silly as all the rest.</p>

<p>It's not at all when it is right.</p>

<p>I wish for a cake.</p>

<p>She said she did.</p>

<p>She said she didn't.</p>


<p class="center heading-space">Gloom.</p>

<p>There was no gloom.</p>

<p>Every room.</p>

<p>There was no room.</p>

<p>There was no room.</p>

<p>She didn't leave me any money.</p>

<p>Head.</p>

<p>Ahead.</p>

<p>I don't want to be visible or invisible.</p>

<p>I don't want a dog named Dick.</p>

<p>It has nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>Intend.</p>

<p>It was in doubt.</p>

<p>In this way we mention this.</p>

<p>This is the story of it.</p>

<p>He was her uncle and nervous.</p>

<p>In their way they had a black police dog.</p>

<p>In his way he had neither relief nor expeditions.</p>

<p>In this thing he was not patient.</p>

<p>If they gave him the money to clean the gutters need
they shut the tobacco shops.</p>

<p>You don't understand that</p>

<p>If they gave him money for the cleaning of city
pipes need he have orders to close butchers.</p>

<p>We can understand the universal. This is universal.</p>

<p>What is the difference between one order and a
reading. A great many read in a park.</p>

<p>Words question it bakeries threaten it but really
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_397" title="397"> </a>hotels receive it. Do we hear about books. Do we.
And catalogues. And catalogues. Farmers for speech.
A great many vines are said to be sold. In France. And
in wealthy homes too. We do not understand the
weather. That astonishes me.</p>

<p>Can you think of me.</p>

<p>Confess it confess it weather burns and in that case
there is plenty of sausage.</p>

<p>Can you think of me at.</p>

<p>And then what happens.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>Of course not.</p>

<p>Thank you for saying that.</p>

<p>Many cases are fine.</p>

<p>In that way we wish.</p>

<p>We think.</p>

<p>We recover.</p>

<p>In that way we swim. Camelias finish when roses
begin.</p>

<p>Let me tell you about this. We were disappointed in

<p>Camelias.</p>

<p>Camelias.</p>

<p>I do not care to mention it again.</p>

<p>I do it.</p>

<p>How do I not.</p>

<p>It is astonishing that those who have fought so hard

<p>Can you feel a home.</p>

<p>See it with them.</p>

<p>And then a pansy.</p>

<p>I did not ask for it.</p>

<p>I meant this to be intelligible.</p>

<p>We were taking a trip. We found the roads not
noisy but pleasurable and the shade there was pleasant.
We found that the trees had been planted so as to make
rows. This is almost universal.</p>

<p>In coming to a village we ask them can they come to
see us we mean near enough to talk and then we ask
them how do we go there.</p>

<p>This is not fanciful.</p>

<p>In advance we have spoken, of what, can you imagine
obedience as a subject. It is. It is laughable when
there is no need of any backing. Can you understand
that in two ways.</p>

<p>We mean to be lean. Lean to me. And then what a
girl. No girl and Emil. We like fresh cooking. So does
anybody.</p>

<p>No everybody doesn't.</p>

<p>The right spirit. There are difficulties and they must
be met in the right spirit.</p>

<p>This is an illustration of the difficulties we have in
many ways.</p>

<h2><a name="TOURTY_OR_TOURTEBATTRE">TOURTY OR TOURTEBATTRE<br/>
<small>A STORY OF THE GREAT WAR</small></a></h2></div>


<p>Tourtebattre came to visit us in the court he said he
heard Americans were in town and he came to see us
and we said what is your name and what americans have
you known and we said we would go to see him and we
did not and we did not give him anything.</p>

<p>Then when we went out to see the hospital we did
not take him anything. We asked to see him. Then
when the new things came we did take a package to him
and we did not see him but he came and called on us to
thank us and we were out.</p>


<p class="center heading-space">Reflections.</p>

<p>If I must reflect I reflect upon Ann Veronica. This
is not what is intended. Mrs. Tourtebattre. Of this we
know nothing.</p>

<p>Can we reflect one for another.</p>

<p>Profit and loss is three twenty five never two seventy
five.</p>

<p>Yes that is the very easy force, decidedly not.</p>

<p>Then Tourtebattre used to come all the time and then
he used to tell us how old he was when he was asked and
he took sugar in his coffee as it was given to him. He
was not too old to be a father he was thirty seven and he
had three children and he told us that he liked to turn
a phrase.</p>

<p>China. Whenever he went to the colonies his sister
was hurt in an automobile accident. This did not mean
that she suffered.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_402" title="402"> </a>
Some one thought she was killed. Will you please
put that in.</p>

<p>His father's watch, his wife gave all his most
precious belongings to a man who did not belong to the
town he said he belonged to. We did not know the truth
of this.</p>


<p class="center heading-space">Reflections.</p>

<p>We should not color our hero with his wife's misdeeds.
Because you see he may be a religion instead of
a talker. Little bones have to come out of his hand for
action this was after his wound. A good deal.</p>

<p>He was wounded in the attack in April right near
where he was always going to visit his wife and he saw
the church tower and then he was immediately evacuated
to an american hospital where every one was very American
and very kind and Miss Bell tried to talk french to
him and amuse him but overcome with her difficulties
with the french language she retired which made him say
she was very nice and these stories that he told to us you
told to Sister Cecile which did not please her and she
said we must come and hear from every one else the
stories they all told of the kindness they had received in
the American hospital before they came to her and she
said to them what did the major do, and they said he
played ball. He did. And you too and all of them said,
no sister but you were wounded in an attack. We were
both wounded, said the soldier.</p>


<p class="center heading-space">Reflections.</p>

<p>Reflections on Sister Cecile lead us to believe that
she did not reflect about Friday but about the book in
which she often wrote. We were curious. She wrote
this note. This is it. Name life, wife, deed, wound,
weather, food, devotion, and expression.</p>

<p>What did he ask for.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_403" title="403"> </a>
Why I don't know.</p>

<p>Why don't you know.</p>

<p>I don't call that making literature at all.</p>

<p>What has he asked for.</p>

<p>I call literature telling a story as it happens.</p>

<p>Facts of life make literature.</p>

<p>I can always feel rightly about that.</p>

<p>We obtained beads for him and our own pictures
in it.</p>

<p>Dear pictures of us.</p>

<p>We can tell anything over.</p>

<p>We gave him colored beads and he made them with
paper that he bought himself of two different colors into
frames that we sent with our pictures to our cousins and
our papas in America.</p>

<p>Can we say it.</p>

<p>We cannot.</p>

<p>Now.</p>

<p>Then he told us about his wife and his child.</p>

<p>Some immediate provision was necessary.</p>

<p>We said in English these are the facts which we are

<p>What is capitol.</p>

<p>He told us of bead buttons and black and white. He

<p>He is a man.</p>


<p class="center heading-space">Reflections.</p>

<p>What were the reflections.</p>

<p>Have we undertaken too much.</p>

<p>What is the name of his wife.</p>

<p>They were lost. We did not look forward. We did
not think much. How long would he stay. Our reflections
really came later.</p>

<p>The first thing we heard from her was that the
woman was not staying and had left her new address.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_404" title="404"> </a>
How do you do.</p>

<p>We did not look her up.</p>

<p>Her mother and her mother.</p>

<p>Can you think why Marguerite did not wish Jenny
Picard to remain longer.</p>

<p>Because she stole.</p>

<p>Not really.</p>

<p>Yes indeed. Little things.</p>

<p>This will never do.</p>

<p>And then.</p>

<p>I said we must go to see her.</p>

<p>And you said we will see.</p>

<p>One night, no one day she called with her mother.</p>

<p>Who was very good looking.</p>

<p>She was very good looking.</p>

<p>And the little boy.</p>

<p>Can you think of the little boy.</p>

<p>They both said that they were not polite.</p>

<p>But they were.</p>

<p>Reflections can come already.</p>

<p>We believed her reasons were real reasons.</p>

<p>Who is always right.</p>

<p>Not she nor her eleven sisters.</p>

<p>No one knew who was kind to her.</p>

<p>What is kindness.</p>

<p>Kindness is being soft or good and has nothing to do
with amiable. Albert is kind and good.</p>

<p>And their wives.</p>

<p>Can you tell the difference between wives and
children.</p>

<p>Queen Victoria and Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>They made you jump.</p>

<p>And I said the mother you said the mother. I did
not remember the mother was in Paris but you did.</p>

<p>A family likeness pleases when there is a cessation
of resemblances. This is to say that points of remarkable
resemblance are those which make Henry leading. Henry
leading actually smothers Emil. Emil is pointed. He
does not overdo examples. He even hesitates.</p>

<p>But am I sensible. Am I not rather efficient in sympathy
or common feeling.</p>

<p>I was looking to see if I could make Marcel out of it
but I can't.</p>

<p>Not a doctor to me not a debtor to me not a d to me
but a c to me a credit to me. To interlace a story with
glass and with rope with color and roam.</p>

<p>How many people roam.</p>

<p>Dark people roam.</p>

<p>Can dark people come from the north. Are they
dark then. Do they begin to be dark when they have
come from there.</p>

<p>Any question leads away from me. Grave a boy
grave.</p>

<p>What I do recollect is this. I collect black and white.
From the standpoint of white all color is color. From
the standpoint of black. Black is white. White is black.
Black is black. White is black. White and black is black
and white. What I recollect when I am there is that
words are not birds. How easily I feel thin. Birds do
not. So I replace birds with tin-foil. Silver is thin.</p>

We don't want to spend the money.</p>

<p>They went to spend their money. We all spend our

I have a car. That is to say I have spent my money. I

there. This is a country. A fine country. This is a fine

<p>Then we have the country. Let us imagine the
country. A country with a wait and wait by me and wait
by me and always always always always wait and always
wait and always wait and always always wait and wait

<p>The family manages to get along and then some one

touch, so what do they do they decide to embrew his
mother and sister and father too. And how did they
escape by paying <ins title="somebody">sombody</ins> money.</p>

<p>That is what you did with the Boche. You always

<p>This was the first thing we heard in Alsatia.</p>

<p>Canary, roses, violets and curtains and bags and
churches and rubber tires and an examination.</p>
